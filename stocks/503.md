#503: 非传统的股票
##简介

　　如果不对我们可能称之为“非常规股票”的东西进行考察，我们对股市的讨论就不完整。我们将三种类型的证券归为这一类:房地产投资信托(REITs)、主有限责任合伙(MLPs)和特许权使用费信托。这些证券交易与股票一样，但有重要的区别，特别是在税收待遇方面。让我们来看看每种安全类型的优缺点。

##房地产投资信托基金的好处

　　房地产投资信托(REIT)是一家拥有和管理可产生收入的房地产的公司。reit是由国会在1960年通过的一项法案创立的，目的是让大投资者和小投资者都能享受到商业地产的租金收入。房地产投资信托基金受到许多规定的约束，其中最重要的一条是，它们每年必须将至少90%的应纳税收入作为股息分配给股东;REIT允许从其应纳税收入中扣除支付给股东的股息。其他重要的条例包括:

* 资产要求:至少75%的资产必须是房地产、现金和政府证券。
* 收入要求:总收入的至少75%必须来自租金、抵押贷款利息或其他房地产投资。
* 股权要求:REIT的股份必须由至少100名股东持有。

　　reit按属性类型专门化。他们投资于大多数主要的房地产类型，近三分之二的投资在办公室、公寓、购物中心、地区商场和工业设施。其余部分则被划分为酒店、自助仓储设施、医疗地产和一些特殊的房地产投资信托基金，这些基金拥有从监狱、剧院、高尔夫球场到林地等各种资产。

　　reit的一些好处包括:

　　**高收益率**。对许多投资者来说，reit的主要吸引力在于其股息收益率。2012年9月，REIT的平均股息收益率约为4.3%，远高于标准普尔500指数的收益率，但远低于REIT的长期平均股息收益率，后者一直在7%-8%的区间内波动(近期REIT的受欢迎程度推高了股价，压低了收益率)。此外，房地产投资信托基金的股息来自长期租赁的稳定租金，许多房地产投资信托基金经理在资产负债表上使用保守的杠杆。

　　**简单的税收待遇**。与大多数合伙企业不同，REIT投资者面临的税务问题相当简单。每年，reit都会向其股东发送表格1099-DIV，其中包含股息分配的明细。出于税收目的，股息分配给普通收入、资本收益和资本回报。由于reit不按企业纳税，投资者对股息的普通收入部分按个人税率纳税。如果房地产投资信托基金出售资产，将产生按资本利得征税的股息部分。资本回报，或超过REIT收益和利润的净分配，不作为普通收入征税，而是用于降低股东在股票中的成本基础。当股票最终被出售时，股票价格和减少的税基之间的差额被作为资本利得征税。

　　**房地产投资信托基金股份的流动性**。房地产投资信托基金的股票在证券交易所买卖。相比之下，购买和出售房地产直接涉及较高的费用，需要大量的努力。

多样化。研究表明，将reit纳入多元化投资组合可以提高回报率，降低风险，因为reit与标普500指数几乎没有相关性。

##房地产投资信托基金的缺点

　　reit也有一些缺点，包括:

对其他高收益资产的需求非常敏感。总体而言，利率上升可能会使美国国债更具吸引力，从reit吸引资金，并降低其股价。

　　**房产税**。reit必须缴纳财产税，财产税最高可占到总运营费用的25%。州和市政府可以提高财产税，以弥补预算缺口，从而减少股东的现金流。

　　**税率**。高收益房地产投资信托基金的一个不利之处是，股息税到期，而股息税通常高于目前大多数股息税的15%。这是因为，很大一部分房地产投资信托基金的股息(通常约为四分之三，尽管各房地产投资信托基金的股息差异很大)被视为普通收入，通常税率更高。

##Benefits of MLPs

In recent years, many U.S. energy firms have reorganized their slow-growing, yet stable businesses, such as pipelines and storage terminals, into master limited partnerships, or MLPs. There are some important differences between buying shares of a corporation and buying a stake in an MLP. With MLPs, investors buy units of the partnership, rather than shares of stock, and are referred to as "unitholders."
There are two classes of MLP owner: general partners and limited partners. General partners manage the day-to-day operations of the partnership. An MLP technically has no employees, so all services, from management to bookkeeping, are provided by the general partner. All other investors are limited partners and have no involvement in the partnership's operations. Limited-partner units are publicly traded, while general-partner units usually are not. The general partner stake is often 2% of the partnership, though the general partner can also own limited-partner units to increase its percentage of ownership.
Companies that use the MLP format tend to operate in very stable, slow-growing industries, such as pipelines. These types of firms usually offer dim prospects for unit price appreciation, but the stability of the industries that use the MLP format means below-average risk for investors. Cash distributions usually stay relatively steady over time (growing at little more than overall inflation), causing MLP units to trade somewhat like bonds, rising when interest rates fall and vice versa.
Some benefits of MLPs include:
High Yield. Most MLPs offer very attractive yields, generally falling in the 6%-7% range.
Consistent Distributions Over Time. The businesses operated as MLPs tend to be very stable and produce consistent cash flows year after year, making the cash distributions on MLP units very predictable.
Capital Gains. Firms primarily switch to the MLP structure to avoid taxes. While shareholders in a corporation face double taxation--paying taxes first at the corporate level, and then at the personal level when those earnings are received as dividends--owners of a partnership are taxed only once: when they receive distributions. There is no partnership equivalent of corporate income tax. Cash distributions to owners often exceed partnership income, and when they do, the difference is counted as a return of capital to the limited partner and taxed at the capital gains rate when the unitholder sells. Not only are capital gains deferred until an owner decides to sell, but capital gains tax rates are lower than income tax rates.  In fact, we're particularly fond of pipeline MLPs, which have ample growth opportunities thanks to shifting sources of supplies of crude oil and natural gas. However, unlike other energy companies, MLPs tend not to take on commodity exposures, reducing risk and cash flow volatility. With distributions typically yielding 6-8% (and growing by 5-10% annually) and offering the opportunity for capital gains, MLPs could provide a compelling total return to investors.
Lower Cost of Capital. The absence of taxes at the company level gives MLPs a lower cost of capital than is typically available to corporations, allowing the MLPs to pursue projects that might not be feasible for a taxable entity.
General Partner Compensation Aligned with Limited Partners' Interest. Most general partners are paid on a sliding scale, receiving a greater share of each dollar of cash flow as the limited partners' cash distributions rise, giving the general partner an incentive to increase limited-partner distributions.
##Drawbacks of MLPs

Investors should also consider the downsides to MLPs, which include:
Personal Tax Liability. Each unitholder is responsible for paying his or her share of the partnership's income taxes, which can make filing taxes more complicated. This is particularly true for larger unitholders, who may have to pay taxes in the various states in which the partnership operates. Moreover, limited partners might owe taxes on partnership income even if the units are held in a retirement account.
Limited Pool of Investors. MLPs face a smaller pool of potential investors than traditional equities because institutional investors, such as pension funds, are not allowed to hold MLP units without incurring tax liability. These large investors do not ordinarily pay taxes, so they tend to shy away from MLPs.
Institutional investors represent the majority of investor dollars in the market, so eliminating them reduces the potential demand for MLP units. Congress recently approved a provision allowing mutual funds to buy MLPs, which should dramatically increase the number of potential investors.
##Benefits of Royalty Trusts

Royalty trusts, like MLPs, generally invest in energy sector assets. Unlike the steady cash flows at MLPs, royalty trusts generate income from the production of natural resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These cash flows are subject to swings in commodity prices and production levels, which can cause them to be very inconsistent from year to year. The trusts have no physical operations of their own and have no management or employees. Rather, they are merely financing vehicles that are run by banks, and they trade like stocks. Other companies mine the resources and pay royalties on those resources to the trust. For example, Burlington Resources, an oil exploration and production company, is the operator for the assets that the largest U.S. royalty trust, San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (SJT), owns the royalties on.
Royalty trusts end up on most investors' radar screens because of the incredibly high yields some of them offer, many in excess of 10%. In a low-interest-rate environment, it's easy to understand why such an income-producing investment might be garnering more attention.
Many of the positive and negative attributes of owning a royalty trust are similar to those faced by MLP unitholders. The benefits are:
High Yield. Trusts are required to pay out essentially all of their cash flow as distributions. Because of this, nearly all royalty trusts have above-average yields, many wildly above average.
Tax-Advantaged Yield. Due to depreciation and depletion, distributions from most trusts are not considered income in the eyes of the IRS. Rather, these nonincome distributions are used to reduce an owner's cost basis in the stock, which is then taxed at the lower capital gains rate and is deferred until an owner sells.
No Corporate Income Tax. Trusts are merely "pass-through" investment vehicles. The issues surrounding double taxation of dividends do not apply.
Peculiar Tax Credits. Have you ever received a tax credit for producing fuels from nonconventional sources? If you own a royalty trust, you might qualify for such credits. The laws on this issue are in flux, and the credits are generally small, but it's still a nice potential perk.
"Pure" Bets on Commodities. Want to bet on the future price appreciation oBenefits of REITsf natural gas but don't want to get involved with the futures market? An excellent way to do that would be to buy a royalty trust that owns gas. The value of any given trust and the distributions it pays are directly tied to the prices of the underlying commodity. Just remember the sword cuts both ways here. The trust's income (and therefore probably the trust's stock price) could end up falling if commodity prices go down instead of up.
##Drawbacks of Royalty Trusts

The downsides to royalty trusts include the following:
Depletion, Depletion, Depletion. Royalty trusts own royalties on a finite amount of resources. Once those resources are gone, they're gone. As the resources deplete, royalties and distributions will fall and will, eventually, go to zero. In financial terms, there is no terminal value. Granted, most trusts won't hit this point for two or three decades (or more), but it's still incredibly important to consider that distributions will eventually contract and disappear.
Volatile Distributions. Trusts typically pay out their distributions on a quarterly or monthly basis. If royalties fall in that period due to the underlying commodity price tanking, distributions will also fall. It's entirely conceivable that a trust that yielded 15% in the last 12 months could yield 3% in the next 12.
Tax-Filing Complexity. Owners of royalty trusts are required to report the pro rata portion of a trust's total income and expenses on their tax returns. This typically means filing Schedules E and B as well as having additional work with Form 1040.
State Income Taxes. Owners of trusts are liable for paying income taxes in the states in which the trust generates its royalties. Different states have different thresholds for when taxes have to actually be filed and paid, and the likelihood of owing income tax in multiple states increases with the size of a given ownership position.
##The Bottom Line
Though they require a bit of work to understand and may increase tax complexity, investing in REITs, MLPs, and royalty trusts can boost the income-producing power of most portfolios.

#106: 收集相关的信息
##简介
　　既然我们已经知道了股票的定义和公司的目的，那么我们该如何收集感兴趣的公司的更多信息呢?因为在投资方面，知识才是真正的力量，作为股票投资者的成功取决于定位信息和确定信息重要性的能力。在这一节中，我们将向你指出正确的方向，并告诉你应该在哪里集中精力。
##整理公共档案
　　开始的时候公开文件可能看起来给人的感觉是云里雾里的，但在研究一个公司时，它们是你读到的最重要的文件。

　　如果一家公司在纽约证券交易所(NYSE)这样的大型交易所上市，就需要向大众提供一些必要的文件，这些文件被提交到美国证券交易委员会(SEC)。美国证券交易委员会指定了这些文件中应该公布哪些的信息，并且公司需要及时地提交这些文件。

　　在现有的公开文件中，最全面和最有用的文件是10-K。10-K是一份年度报告，概述了公司的基本信息，包括员工数量、业务风险、财产描述和公司战略。10-K也包含该公司审计的年终财务报表。除了拥有重要的事实和数字之外，10-K还包括管理层对过去一年的的讨论和分析，并将其与前几年进行比较。

　　我们建议在研究一家公司的过程中，首先应该关注这个公司的10-K，在哪里能够找到一个上市公司的10-K呢？只要访问美国证券交易委员会的网站，点击“文件和表格”，然后“搜索公司文件”。把你的公司的名字加入“公司和其他文件”并搜索，你可以从表格的列表中挑选出10-K。只要在搜索框中输入公司的名称或代码，然后选择“归档”选项卡就可以了。(网站可能已经改版，但是还是可以找到的)

What about all those other forms? Some of them are worth a read. For instance, the 10-Q contains some of the same data that you'll find in the 10-K, except that it is published on a quarterly basis. Although it's a little less comprehensive and the financial statements are typically unaudited, the 10-Q is a good way to keep tabs on a company throughout the year.


Another important document is the annual proxy statement, also called DEF 14a. In the proxy, you will find detailed 
information about executive compensation, the board of directors, and the shareholder voting process. The proxy is a 
must read for gaining better insight into the corporate governance of the company you're researching and determining 
your rights as a potential shareholder.

If you're interested in a recent event, typically associated with an earnings release or major company announcement, 
you can find the details in the most recent 8-K. Also, you may want to occasionally peruse the Form 4's to see if 
insiders have been trading company stock. Every time company insiders make a transaction in company stock, they are 
required to file the Form 4, allowing you a peek into whether they are buying or selling shares. While an insider's 
trading activity may be no smarter than your own, it can at least reveal if management's investment behavior is 
consistent with its tone. 
##Making the Most of a Company Web Site
Another source of information is the company itself. Just plug the name of the company you want to research into the 
search engine of your choice. You should find the company Web site near the top of your results.

The investor section of a company's website can offer a variety of information. Copies of the public filings are 
usually available in more flexible, downloadable formats--such as PDF, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Word. Also, 
you can sort through the firm's press releases and examine the latest investor presentations (typically in PDF or 
Microsoft Power Point formats).

It's definitely worth a visit to the company Web site. It doesn't take long, and reading the press releases will 
give you some of the most up-to-date information available. Also, it may be useful to see how a company does business 
on the Web.  
##Setting Up a Watch List
After you've researched your first batch of companies (read the public filings and visited company Web sites), 
it's time to set up a watch list.

By creating a watch list, you'll be able to keep tabs on company news and easily find stock price information. 
Among other things, you can set alerts to notify you when a stock price has met or exceeded a particular threshold. 
Thus, your watch list will eventually become an integral tool in helping you make buy and sell decisions, stay 
organized, and keep informed.
##Seeking Out Expert Opinions
After you've become a bit of an expert yourself by sifting through the information we've already discussed, you 
may want to read what other analysts and investors have to say about a particular company. While your investing 
decisions are yours to make, you might be able to gain a new insight or angle by reading others' research. 
##Avoiding Information Overload
You shouldn't feel bad if you can't read every article from every source that comments on a company you're researching. In 
your journey to becoming an informed stock investor, you'll almost inevitably feel overwhelmed from time to time by the 
vast amounts of information available. Fortunately, you don't need to read it all to be successful. In fact, some 
information may actually harm your performance by taking your focus away from what's truly important. That's why 
we've highlighted the key pieces of information you will need to make an informed decision.

Here's a quick step-by-step guide to becoming informed about a company:
1. Obtain the firm's 10-K and really try to give it a thoughtful read. Don't feel bad if you spend a lot of time on 
this step. (Give it a couple of days to digest.)
2. Read through the 10-Qs when they are released each quarter. These are usually much shorter than the 10-K and 
shouldn't require more than an hour or two of your time.
3. Set up a watch list to organize the steady flow of news on all the companies that interest you.
4. Poke around on the company's Web site. This takes less than a half hour.
5. When time allows, visit relevant industry Web sites and catch up on  some of the industry trends.
##The Bottom Line
If you follow these steps, you'll be able to form a foundation of understanding about a company in about a week. Over 
time, you can build on your foundation and gain a much deeper understanding. Further, you'll be able to weed out the 
news that just isn't worth your time. All told, if you stay the course, you could be surprised how your knowledge will 
grow by applying this simple process.

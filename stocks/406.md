#406: 使用晨星的股票评级
##简介

　　令人惊讶的是，有些人对股票报价如此关注，而他们却很少关注他们正在收购的基础业务的价值。

　　在晨星(Morningstar)，我们将股票评估为业务的一部分，而不是“带有图表的微小波动”。我们认为，以低于公允价值的价格购买优质企业的股票，并允许这些企业长期实现复合价值，是在股市创造财富的最可靠方式。

　　市场可能并不总是同意我们的长期投资理念，因此有时我们的建议与共识思维不一致。 当股票价格高而且价值很高时，相对较少的股票将获得最高的5星级晨星评级。 但当市场暴跌时，将有更多的五星级股票。 我们认为好公司比廉价公司更便宜，因此我们发现市场过热时机会较少。 如果我们会等到衣服和平板电视开始降价销售的时候才买，为什么我们不应该以便宜的价格购买股票？
　　
　　晨星公司近20年来一直在分析投资策略，我们已经成为将成功风格与普通大多数人分开的专家。 在本课中，我们将分享我们对股票评级的方法，以便您有机会从我们的投资策略中受益并在市场中建立持久的财富。

##什么是公允价值？

　　大多数投资，无论是买房还是买股票，都归结为最初的支出，然后(希望如此)是未来的收入流。关键在于为未来预期的收入流确定一个公平的价格。

　　假设一只股票的交易价格是每股20美元。如果你计算一下这些数字——预计的销售增长、未来的利润率等等——你可能会估计该股的合理每股价格为30美元。你为股票支付20美元，作为回报，你将获得价值30美元的收入流。这是一笔好交易。如果这只股票的交易价格是40美元，高于未来收入流的公允价值30美元，那么你就在看一只昂贵的股票。

　　在晨星(Morningstar)，我们的分析师通过确定我们今天将为该公司未来产生的所有过剩现金流支付多少，来估算该公司的公允价值。我们通过使用一个详细的贴现现金流模型(见股票403)来预测公司未来的财务表现，从而得出这个价值，该模型将公司损益表、资产负债表和现金流量表的预测因素考虑在内。其结果是由分析师驱动的对该股公允价值的估计。

##我们如何来评级?

　　晨星对股票的评级是基于一只股票的市场价格相对于其估计公允价值(经风险调整)。一般来说，与我们分析师的公允价值估值相比，大幅折让的股票将获得更高的(4或5)星评级，而溢价较大的股票将获得较低的(1或2)星评级。与我们分析师的公允价值估值非常接近的股票通常会获得3星评级。

　　并不是所有的公司都是生而平等的。因此，当一家公司的质量下降时，我们对其公允价值评估的折扣就会增加。我们要求高质量企业提供较小的折扣，因为我们对自己的现金流预测和公允价值更有信心。未来本来就是不确定的，这种不确定性对一些公司来说比其他公司更大。因此，对于风险较大或不确定的业务，我们要求更大的折扣。

When investing in any asset, you should expect a return that adequately compensates you for the risks inherent in the investment. Assuming that the stock's market price and fair value eventually converge, 3-star stocks should offer a "fair return." A fair return is one that adequately compensates you for the riskiness of the stock. Put another way, 3-star stocks should offer investors a return that's roughly equal to the stock's cost of equity. The cost of equity is often called the "required return," because it represents the return an investor requires for taking on the risk of owning a stock.
On the other hand, 5-star stocks should offer an investor a return that's well above the company's cost of equity. High-risk, 5-star stocks should also offer a better expected return than low-risk, 5-star stocks. Conversely, low-rated stocks have significantly lower expected returns. If a stock drops to 1 star, that means we expect it to lose money for investors based on our assessment of the stock's fair value.
It is important to remember that if a stock's market price is significantly above our fair value estimate, it will receive a lower star rating, no matter how wonderful we think the business or its management is. Even the best company is a poor investment if an investor overpays for its shares.

What Causes a Star Rating to Change?
Morningstar's stock star ratings are updated daily, and therefore they can change daily. The ratings can change because of a move in the stock's price, a change in the analyst's estimate of the stock's fair value, a change in the analyst's assessment of a company's business risk, or a combination of any of these factors. The Morningstar Rating for stocks includes a small buffer around the cutoff between each rating to reduce the number of rating changes produced by random market "noise." If a $50 stock moves up and down by $0.25 each day over a few days, the buffer will prevent the star rating from changing each day based on this insignificant change.
It is important to note that our fair value estimates do not change very often, but the market prices do. Therefore, stocks often gain or lose stars based just on movement in the share price. If we think a stock's fair value is $50, and the shares decline to $40 without a change in the intrinsic value of the business, the star rating will go up. Our estimate of what the business is worth hasn't changed, but the shares are more attractive as an investment at $40 than they were at $50.

A Different Valuation Approach&
Morningstar's fair value estimate analysis is based on a different valuation methodology than ratio-based approaches. If you've ever talked about P/E or P/B (as we did in Stocks 108), you have valued stocks using ratios, also known as multiples. Investors like to use ratios because they are easy to calculate and readily available. The downside is that making sense of valuation ratios usually requires a bit of context. A company can have a high P/E or P/B but still be cheap based on fair value. If a computer company can grow fast enough, its stock will deserve a high P/E, and it might even be a bargain. Likewise, a company in a dying industry with negative growth may have a low P/E and still be overvalued.
We believe that looking at future profits allows for a more sophisticated approach to stock valuation. By determining a company's fair value based on a projection of a company's future cash flows, we can determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. The advantage of this approach is that the result is easy to understand and does not require as much context as the basic ratios. While it takes more time and expertise to estimate future cash flows, we believe that valuing stocks in this way allows investors to spot bargains and make more intelligent investments.

The Bottom Line

Above all, keep in mind that true investing means buying a stake in a superior business at a discounted price and allowing that business to compound in value over a long period of time. It isn't hopping on the latest hot concept hoping for a quick profit. That's why the Morningstar Rating for stocks does not attempt to prognosticate short-term price movements or momentum. We believe that the long-term value of a stock is tied to how much value the company generates for its shareholders.

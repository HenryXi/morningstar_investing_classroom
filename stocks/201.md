#201: 股票和税收
##简介
　　圣经上说死亡和税收是人生不可避免的两件事.但税收与死亡不同，至少税收可以最小化。在这节课中，我们将考察和股票投资和审查相关的美国个人税收的基本框架以及回顾一些简单的步骤，通过这些步骤你可以成为一个更有效率的投资者。

　　本节课的相关内容并不仅限于股票投资;其中大部分也与共同基金投资有关。无论你打算投资哪种资产类别(包括股票)，确切地了解税收是如何运作是很重要的，这样你就可以尽可能地把钱放在口袋里，远离山姆大叔。
##普通收入和资本收益
　　资本收益是指你卖出一只股票的价格与你买入一只股票的价格之差.这部分的收益在税收上按低于普通收入的税率征税。普通收入包括工资和利息收入等项目。

　　当你以高于购买价格出售资本资产(如股票)时，就会产生资本收益。资本收益进一步细分为短期和长期。如果股票在一年内卖出，收益是短期的，并按较高的普通收入税率征税。如果你在卖出前持有股票超过一年，那么收益是长期的，将按较低的资本收益率征税。

　　相反，当你以低于购买的价格出售资产时，你资本会损失。虽然赔钱从来都不是一件有趣的事，但你可以利用资本损失来抵消资本收益，从而减少你的税收。此外，如果资本损失超过资本收益，你可以将损失从其他收入中扣除，每年限额为3000美元。超过3000美元阈值的任何额外损失将结转到以后各年使用。(请注意，由于美国国税局的洗牌规则，如果你在出售前30天或之后购买了大量相同的证券，你就不能索赔损失。)
##2003年的《就业与增长税收减免和解法案》
　　大多数纳税人为股息和长期资本利得支付15%的税率——自2003年《就业与增长税收减免和解法案》(Jobs & Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act)通过以来，这一水平一直保持着。(从2013年开始，高收入者的投资税确实提高了:年收入超过40万美元的单身纳税人和共同年收入超过45万美元的已婚夫妇对股息和长期资本利得支付20%的税率。)
Prior to 2003, dividends were taxed at an investor's ordinary income-tax rate. The basic idea behind the 2003 dividend tax cut was to reduce the burden of "double taxation," or taxation of the same profits at both the corporate and shareholder level, so any dividends paid out of profits not subject to corporate taxation will not be considered "qualified dividends" eligible for the reduced tax rate. Therefore, one notable exception is dividends from real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which are typically still taxed at ordinary income rates. In addition, to qualify for the reduced dividend tax rate, you must have held a stock for at least 60 days out of the 120-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (the date on which you must be holding a stock to receive the dividend).
　　2003年以前，股息是作为投资者的普通所得进行纳税的。2003年股息减税背后的基本思想是降低"双重征税"的负担,即同一部分利润在企业和股东上收取了两次税,因此，任何以不受公司税收影响的利润支付的股息，都不会被视为符合降低税率的“合格股息”。因此，一个值得注意的例外是房地产投资信托公司(REITs)的股息，后者通常仍按普通收入税率征税。此外，为了符合降低的股息税率，你必须持有股票至少60天，从120天开始，开始前60天的前股利日期(你必须持有股票以获得股息的日期)。
##税收优惠账户
One easy way to become a more tax-efficient stock investor is to utilize tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). These special accounts allow you to enjoy either tax-deferred or tax-free growth of your investments.
Tax deferral can lead to significant savings over time. Let's assume two investors each start with $10,000 and earn a 10% annual return for 30 years. One has 100% of her gains tax-deferred, while the other realizes the full amount of his capital gains each year and pays a 20% tax on those gains. Under this scenario, the tax-deferred investor ends up with almost $75,000 more at the end than the investor with the taxable gains.
Clearly, it is worthwhile to learn about the types of tax-advantaged accounts available. Below are some of the most popular:
401(k)s
401(k) plans, so named after a section of the Internal Revenue Code, are set up by employers as a retirement-savings vehicle. The primary advantage of a 401(k) is tax deferral. First, employees can contribute a percentage of their income from each paycheck to their own 401(k) accounts on a pretax basis. This means the amount you contribute to your 401(k) is exempt from current federal income tax. For example, if you are in the 25% income tax bracket, a $100 contribution will reduce your current tax burden by $25. Second, dividends and capital gains earned inside a 401(k) are not subject to current taxation. In short, 401(k) plans allow you to defer taxation on dividends, capital gains, and a portion of your wages until you begin withdrawing from the plan, presumably during retirement, when you may be in a lower tax bracket. (All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income rates.)
The amount you can contribute to your 401(k) plan is limited to $17,500 in 2013. You also must begin mandatory withdrawals from your 401(k) when you reach age 70 1/2. Withdrawals made before you turn 59 1/2 are taxed as ordinary income, and you may be subject to an additional 10% penalty.
Traditional IRAs
Individual retirement accounts are another vehicle for tax deferral. When you contribute to a traditional IRA, the IRS allows you to take an income tax deduction up to the amount of the contribution, subject to income limitations. In addition, dividends and capital gains earned inside a traditional IRA are not subject to tax until withdrawal.
However, there are some important limitations to remember. First, you must be age 70 1/2 or younger with earned income to contribute to a traditional IRA. Second, the annual contribution limit is $5,500 in 2013. If you are age 50 or older, you can make additional "catch-up" contributions of $1,000. Finally, like 401(k) plans, you must begin mandatory withdrawals when you reach age 70 1/2. Withdrawals made before you turn 59 1/2 are taxed and may be subject to an additional 10% penalty.
Roth IRAs
These are typically the best retirement account option for many taxpayers. As with traditional IRAs, interest income, dividends, and capital gains accumulate tax-free. However, the main feature of Roth IRAs is that they are funded with aftertax dollars (contributions are not tax deductible). The upside of this is that qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are exempt from federal taxation.
The Roth IRA has the same annual contribution limits and "catch-up" provisions as a traditional IRA, but you must meet certain income requirements to contribute to a Roth IRA. Generally, single filers with income up to $95,000 and joint filers with income up to $150,000 are eligible to make the full annual contribution to a Roth IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time without paying taxes or penalties, but withdrawal of earnings may be subject to income taxation and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if made before you turn 59 1/2.
In addition, the distribution must also be made after a five-tax-year period from the time a conversion or contribution is first made into any Roth IRA. So, if you opened your first Roth IRA and make your first contribution on April 15, 2005, for the 2004 tax year, your five-year period started on Jan. 1, 2004. Assuming you meet the other requirements, distributions made in this case after Dec. 31, 2008, from any Roth IRA will receive tax-free treatment.
Tax Planning 101
Besides taking advantage of 401(k) and IRA accounts, you can also follow a few basic planning strategies for investments held in taxable accounts. However, you should keep in mind that your goal as an investor should be to achieve the highest aftertax rate of return, not to avoid paying taxes. Taxes are a consideration, but they should not control your investment decisions.
The Value of Deferral and Stepped-Up Basis
All things being equal, it is better to pay taxes later than sooner. Therefore, you should endeavor to defer taxation as long as possible. An investor who purchases the shares of sound businesses and patiently holds them will not only enjoy the benefits of tax-free compounding, but will also save on brokerage commissions. At the least, toward the end of the year, you should consider delaying the realization of capital gains until January to defer your tax liability until the following year.
If you are extremely patient and die still owning a stock, your beneficiaries will receive the stock with a "stepped-up" basis, or a basis equal to the market value on the date of your death. Your beneficiaries can then sell the stock and owe no tax on the capital gains accumulated during your lifetime.
Wait for Long-Term Capital Gain Treatment
Purchasing a stock on Jan. 1 and selling it for a gain on Dec. 31 of the same year is likely not to be a smart tax move. In this case, your capital gain is short term and taxed at ordinary income rates. Had you sold the same stock a few days later on Jan. 2 of the following year, the gain would have been treated as long term and taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates, and in addition would be delayed another year.
Take Short-Term Losses
If you happen to have both short-term and long-term capital gains, you may want to consider realizing short-term capital losses on stocks you have held for less than one year. These short-term losses will offset your short-term gains, which are taxed at higher ordinary income rates. This will give you the most tax mileage for your capital loss.
Timing Capital Gains and Losses
When faced with large capital gains and losses, it may be advantageous for you to realize both in the same year. Suppose you have $30,000 of capital gains and $30,000 of capital losses. If you realize only the gain this year, you will have to pay tax on the entire $30,000. If you decide to realize only your loss, you'd have no capital gains to offset it, and you could deduct only $3,000 against your other income. The remaining $27,000 loss must be carried over into future years. Instead of delaying the tax benefits of your loss, you could choose to realize both the capital gain and loss in the same year. Since they completely offset each other, you would not owe any taxes.
On the other hand, if you do not have a large capital loss to offset, you should generally time the realization of long-term capital gains--which will be taxed at favorable rates--for years when you do not realize any capital losses. Then you can realize your future capital losses in years when you can immediately deduct them against other income that may be taxed at higher ordinary income rates.
The Bottom Line
As you can see, taxes can have a meaningful impact on your long-term investment performance. Investing in stocks without regard to the tax impact can greatly reduce your return. But by understanding the basic framework of investment taxation and using a few simple tax-planning strategies, you can work to maximize the only number that matters in the end: the amount of money that goes into your pocket.

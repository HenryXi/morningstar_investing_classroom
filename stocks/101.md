# 101: 股票与其他投资
## 简介
我们每个人都有各自的金融目标：为自己的孩子支付学费，在合适的年龄退休，买一些我们想要的东西。通过节衣缩食的方式去达到上面的目标是远远不够的。
我们另外需要做一些其他的事情去达到自己的金融目标。我们需要去投资，让自己的“钱”工作起来。股票是最简单的也是最好的一种投资方式。

投资股票并不是什么高科技。成功的股票投资者之间唯一真正的特征是基本的数学技能，批判的眼光，耐心和纪律。将这些与理解资金如何流动以及企业如何
相互竞争以及少量会计知识相结合，拥有这些技能你就可以开始进行股票投资了。我们将在这本工作手册中教你上述所有的技能。

尽管你不需要大学学位来投资股票，但选择股票仍然是一项智力活动。它需要你付出努力，相应的你会得到相应的汇报。毕竟，投资股票不仅可以带来潜在的更高投资回报，
还可以更好地了解世界的运作方式。
##什么是股票?

也许投资新手最常见的错误认识是，股票仅仅是纸张交易的一部分。压根就不是那样的。在股票投资中，交易是一种手段，而不是目的。股票是公司的所有权权益。
一个企业是由一个人或一小群投入资金的人创办的。每个创始人拥有的业务数量是由投入多少钱决定的。 这个阶段该公司是私人的。 一旦企业的规模达到一定的程度，
公司可能会决定“上市”并向投资大众出售一大块公司的股份。这就是股票的创建方式。

当你买了股票并持有的这段时间，你成为了这个企业的一个企业主。从长期来看，你所持有的所有权股份的价值会随着企业业务的好坏而上升或下降。生意做得越好，你的股权就越值钱。

##为什么投资股票
股票是投资的一种方法。为什么选择股票而不是其他的选择，比如债券，稀有的硬币，或者古董跑车?很简单，精明的投资者投资股票的原因是
他们提供了最高的潜在回报。从长期来看，没有其他类型的投资会表现得更好。

但是，股票往往是最不稳定的投资。这意味着股票的价值在短期内可能会下降。有时股票价格可能会跌一段时间。例如，标准普尔500指数的10年回报率在2010年末略有下降，
主要是由于2008年金融危机和21世纪初科技泡沫的破裂。坏运气或坏时机很容易使你的回报下降，但你可以通过采取长期投资的方法使其最小化。

谁也不能保证买股票一定会赚钱。如果你瞎眼选择了股价下跌的股票，你可能会亏钱，甚至是长期亏损!

Of course, we think that by educating yourself and using the knowledge in this Investing
Classroom, you can make the risk acceptable relative to your expected reward. We will help you
pick the right businesses to own and help you spot the ones to avoid. Again, this effort is well
worth it, because over the long haul, your money can work harder for you in equities than in just
about any other investment.

当然，我们认为通过在本课程学习，你可以相对有效的控制投资回报和风险让风险相对于你期望的回报。我们将帮助你选择正确的企业，并帮助你发现需要避免的。
同样，这一努力是值得的，因为从长远来看，你的钱在股票上比在任何其他投资中更能让你工作。

##Your Investment Choices

Let's see how stocks stack up to some of your other investment options:
Mutual Funds. Stock mutual funds can offer similar returns to investing in stocks on your
own, but without all the extra work. When you invest in a fund, your money is pooled
with that of other investors, and then it is managed by a group of professionals w ho try
to earn a return by selecting stocks for the pool.

Beyond requiring much less effort, one key advantage of funds is that they can be less
volatile. Simple statistics says that a portfolio is going to experience less volatility than
the individual components of the portfolio. After all, individual stocks can and
sometimes do go to zero, but if a mutual fund held 50 stocks, it would be very unlikely
that all 50 of those stocks become worthless.

The flipside of this reduced volatility is that fund returns can be muted relative to
individual stocks. In investing, risk and return are intimately correlated—reduce one,
and odds are you will reduce the other. Another disadvantage to offloading all the effort
of picking individual stocks is that you must pay someone else for this service. The
professionals running mutual funds do not do so for free. They charge fees, and fees eat
into returns.

Plus, the more money you have invested in mutual funds, the larger the absolute value
of fees you will pay every year. For instance, paying 1% a year in fees on a $1,000
portfolio is not a big deal, but it's a much larger deal if the portfolio is worth $500,000. In
the past, mutual funds often made the most sense for those with relatively small
amounts to invest because they were the most cost-efficient. But with the advent of $10
(or less) per-trade commissions on stocks, this is no longer necessarily the case.

Just as picking the wrong stock is a risk, so is picking the wrong fund. What if the group
of people you selected to manage your investment does not perform well? Just like
stocks, there is no guarantee of a return in mutual funds.

It's also worth noting that investing in a mix of mutual funds and stocks can be a
perfectly prudent strategy. Stocks versus funds (or any other investment vehicle) need
not be an either/or proposition.

Bonds. At their most basic, bonds are loans. When you buy a bond, you become a lender
to an institution, and that institution pays you interest. As long as the institution does
not go bankrupt, it will also pay back the principal on the bond, but no more than the
principal.

There are two basic types of bonds: government bonds and corporate bonds. U.S.
government bonds (otherwise known as T-bills or Treasuries) are issued and guaranteed
by Uncle Sam. They typically offer a modest return with low risk. Corporate bonds are
issued by companies and carry a higher degree of risk (should the company default) as
well as return.

Bond investors must also consider interest rate risk. When prevailing in terest rates rise,
the market value of existing bonds tends to fall. (The opposite is also true.) The only way
to alleviate interest rate risk is by holding the bond to maturity. Investing in corporate
bonds also tends to require just as much homework as stock investing, yet bonds
generally have lower returns.

Given their lower risk, there is certainly a place for bonds or bond mutual funds in most
portfolios, but their relative safety comes with the price of lower expected returns
compared with stocks over the long term.

Real Estate. Most people's homes are indeed their largest investments. We all have to
live somewhere, and a happy side effect is that real estate tends to appreciate in value
over time. But if you are going to use real estate as a true inve stment vehicle by buying a
second home, a piece of land, or a rental property, it's important to keep the following
in mind.

First, despite the strong historical appreciation, real estate can and does decline in
value, as the home price bubble painfully demonstrated to Americans in 2008. Second,
real estate taxes will constantly eat into returns. Third, real estate owners must worry
about physically maintaining their properties or must pay someone else to do it. Likewise,
they often must deal with tenants and collect rents. Finally, real estate is rather illiquid
and takes time to sell—a potential problem if you need your money back quickly.

Some people do nothing but invest their savings in real estate and do quite well. But just
as stock investing requires effort, so does real estate investing.

Bank Savings Accounts. The problem with bank savings accounts and certificates of
deposit is that they offer very low returns. The upside is that there is essentially zero
risk in these investment vehicles, and your principal is protected. These types of
accounts are fine as rainy-day funds—a place to park money for short-term spending
needs or for an emergency. But they really should not be viewed as long-term
investment vehicles.

The low returns of these investments are a problem because of inflation. For instance, if
you get a 3% return on a savings account, but inflation is also dropping the buying power
of your dollar by 3% a year, you really aren't making any money. Your real return (return
adjusted for inflation) is zero, meaning that your money is not really working for you.

##The Bottom Line

Though investing in stocks may indeed require more work and carry a higher degree of
risk compared with other investment opportunities, you cannot ignore the higher
potential return that stocks provide. And as we will show in the next lesson, given
enough time, a slight ly higher return on your investments can lead to dramatically larger
dollar sums for whatever your financial goals in life may be.

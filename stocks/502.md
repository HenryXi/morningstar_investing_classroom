#502: 介绍期权
##简介

　　大量的资金可以在相当短的时间内通过期权获得或失去，这让许多投资者既感兴趣，又感到恐惧。由于与期权相关的术语和概念五花八门，投资者可能很难理解期权。坦率地说，我们不认为每个人都有选择。事实上，许多投资者在没有考虑过的情况下就已经成功地进行了投资。

　　即使你永远不会买进或卖出期权，它在股票市场的份额也足够大，值得关注。在你的投资生涯中，你可能会受到诱惑，“迈出下一步”，利用你的想法。这节课会教你一些基本的知识，这样你就知道你可能会学到什么。

##看涨和看跌股票期权

　　所有关于期权的价差和策略的核心都是看涨和看跌期权。看涨期权赋予持有者在给定时间内以特定价格(即执行价)购买股票的选择权。看跌期权为持有者提供了在一段时间内以特定价格(也称为执行价)出售股票的期权。让我们来看看期权通常是如何表示为特定的股票:

**JUN15 50c**

　　这指的是执行价为50美元的看涨期权，将于2015年6月到期。该看涨期权的持有者将有权在2015年6月期权到期之前的任何时候以50美元的价格购买该股票。

**AUG14 75p**

　　这指的是执行价为75美元的看跌期权，将于2014年8月到期。该看跌期权的持有者将有权在2014年8月期权到期之前，随时以75美元的价格出售斯托克k型期权。

##什么是期权合同?

　　期权以合约的形式进行交易。每一份合同赋予期权买方/所有者100股标的股票在到期时的权利。因此，如果你购买了7个看涨期权合同，你就获得了购买700股的权利。

　　每一个期权合同的买方都有一个卖方(也称为期权的作者)。作为创建期权时收到的现金的交换，期权作者放弃了在期权期间向其他人购买或出售标的股票的权利。例如，如果看涨期权的所有者行使他或她以特定价格购买股票的权利，期权作者必须以该价格交付股票。

##理解期权定价

　　看涨期权和看跌期权定义中的两个关键短语是“买入期权”和“卖出期权”。看涨期权或看跌期权的持有者没有义务采取任何行动。因此，一个看涨或看跌期权在到期前的价值永远不会低于$0。考虑下面的例子:

　　你拥有一个看涨期权，它赋予你以50美元购买股票的权利。不过，该股在到期日的定价为45美元。当你可以在股票市场上以更低的价格购买股票时，你为什么要行使以50美元购买股票的权利呢?你不会。因此，当股票价格低于执行价时，你的看涨期权价值为0美元，在本例中执行价为50美元。

　　当谈到期权价格时，人们通常指的是内在价值和内在价值溢价。(这个内在价值与我们所说的公司现金流贴现时的内在价值无关。)期权的内在价值是其执行价格与标的股票价格之间的差额，当它有利于期权的所有者时。人们通常把期权的内在价值称为期权的“价值”。让我们来看三个例子，假设我们是在2012年:

1. 2013年2月 60美元，当时股价为75美元

　　在本例中，您拥有一个看涨期权，允许您在股票以75美元交易时以60美元购买股票。我们会说这个看涨期权的内在价值是15美元因为它给了你以低于你在股票市场上购买价格15美元的价格购买股票的权利。

2. 2014年10月 80美元，当时股价为50美元

　　在这种情况下，你拥有一个看跌期权，当股票以50美元交易时，你可以以80美元的价格卖出股票。我们会说看跌期权的内在价值是30美元因为它赋予你以30美元的价格卖出股票的权利比你在股票市场上卖出股票的价格要高。

3. 2013年7月 50美元，该股交易价为40美元

　　在本例中，您拥有一个看涨期权，允许您在股票以40美元交易时以50美元购买股票。这个选项没有内在价值。它被认为是“out of the money”。

　　让我们仔细看看上面的第三个例子。虽然它没有内在价值，但我们发现，期权在市场上的交易价格约为2美元。这是为什么呢?虽然期权现在不在现金中，但股票仍有一段时间(在到期日之前)可以移动，以便将期权放入现金中。这被称为时间价值或期权价值。

　　在第二个例子中，期权的交易价格可能是32美元，即使其内在价值只有30美元。在这种情况下，期权的交易价格比其内在价值高出2美元。这种溢价也称为时间价值。

##期权价值驱动因素
There are several key factors that influence the value of an option. First, the level of volatility in the underlying stock plays a key role. The higher the stock's volatility, the greater the value of the option. If the underlying stock is more volatile, it means the option has a greater chance of trading in the money before the option expires.
　　
Second, the amount of time left until the option expires influences the option's value. The more time left until expiration, the greater the value of the option. Again, the longer until expiration, the more time for an option to trade or finish in the money.
Finally, the direction the underlying stock trades will affect the value of the option. If a stock appreciates, it will positively affect call options and negatively impact put options. If a stock falls, it will have the opposite effect.

Basic Option Strategy—Leaps

There are literally scores of option strategies. Straddles, strangles, and butterflies are just some of the main types of strategies where an investor can use options (or sets of options) to bet on any number of stock and market movements. Most of these are beyond the scope of this lesson, so we will just focus on two strategies most often used by value investors.
First, leaps are options with relatively long time horizons, typically lasting for a year or two. (The term "leaps" is an acronym for "long-term equity anticipation securities.") Some value-oriented investors like call option leaps because they have such long time horizons and typically require less capital than buying the underlying stock.
For example, a stock may be trading for about $60, but the call options with two years to expiration and a $70 strike price may trade for $10. If an investor thinks the stock is worth $100 and will appreciate to that price before the leap expires, he or she could find the leap very attractive. Rather than spending $6,000 to purchase 100 shares of the stock, he or she could buy one leap contract for $1,000 (1 contract x $10 x 100). If the stock closes at $100 at expiration two years from now, the leap position would return $2,000 (1 contract x ($30 – $10) x 100). This would mark a $2,000 profit on a $1,000 investment (200%). However, if he or she had just purchased the stock, it would have marked a $4,000 profit on a $6,000 investment (67%).
As we see above, leaps can offer investors better returns. However, this bigger bang for the buck does not come without some additional risks. If the stock had finished at $70, the leap investor would have lost his/her $1,000 while the stock investor would have made $1,000. Also, the leap investor doesn't get to collect dividends, unlike the stock investor.
Let's also consider a case where this stock trades at $70 at the leap's expiration, but then goes up to $110 soon after expiration. The owner of the stock enjoys the appreciation to $110, but the option holder in our example is out of luck.
This latest example highlights perhaps the reason why options are a tough nut to crack for most investors. To be successful with options, you not only have to be correct about the direction of a stock's movement, you also have to be correct about the timing and magnitude of that movement. Deciding whether or not a company's stock is undervalued is difficult enough, and betting on when "Mr. Market" is going to be in one mood or the other adds great complexity.
Another Strategy--Baby Puts

"Baby puts" refer to put options that are far out of the money, and therefore trade cheaply. Investors will sell these baby puts on stocks that they are comfortable purchasing at a specific price, which will be the strike price of the put they are selling. Typically, this is the price that builds in a margin of safety to their estimate of the stock's fair value. 
For example, say an investor would be happy to purchase Coca-Cola (KO) for $35 per share, but the stock is trading at $45. It's currently January, and the investor notices that the May $35 put options are trading for $1. The investor decides to sell (write) the May $35 put options for $1. This means the investor collects $1 for selling the right to someone else to sell the investor the stock for $35 anytime before the option's May expiration date. So, if Coca-Cola stock doesn't fall below $35 by the May expiration, the investor pockets the $1. However, if the stock falls below $35 before May, the investor will probably be required to purchase Coca-Cola stock for $35, because the person to whom he or she sold the put option will exercise his or her right to sell the stock for $35.
Value investors might be willing to partake in this strategy because they decided in advance that $35 was a good price to purchase Coca-Cola stock. And, if the stock doesn't fall below $35, they get to collect $1 (by selling the baby put) as they wait for Coke's stock to trade cheaper.
This strategy is not without some fairly large risks. If the investor doesn't have enough cash in his or her account to purchase the stock, the investor's broker may require additional funds be deposited. We'd recommend considering this strategy only if an investor has plenty of cash on hand. Also, a fresh piece of news could surface (between the time the investor sells the put and the put expires) that might change the investor's opinion of the fair value of the stock.
The Bottom Line

Some investors like options because they require less capital and thereby offer potentially greater returns. Others like to use them to execute strategies like the "baby put" example above. However, options also possess risks that will repel many investors, and rightfully so, in our opinion. Like we mentioned earlier, one can have a very successful investing career without spending a moment thinking about options.

#104: 什么重要，什么不重要
##简介
　　不同的人对股票投资的概念有着不同的看法。为了更好的帮助读者学习股票知识，我们要明确下面的几个观点。
##投资不等于交易
　　你的印象中对于股票投资的认识可能是这样的：一群人喝着提神的咖啡，然后拿着电话面对着电脑屏幕上的各种信息，一边沟通一边在商量着要不要买进或者卖掉
哪只股票。

　　忘掉上面所描述的景象吧，因为股票投资不等于交易，更不用说是那种面对着最先进的计算机，然后根据获取的不同消息对股票进行买入或卖出这种夸张的
方式。尽管一些专业人士可能通过高频率的股票交易来谋生，但是这种“日交易”并不是个人投资的最佳方式。

　　频繁的股票交易不但需要时时刻刻的追踪股票信息，而且还有下面几个缺点。首先，随着交易频次的增加交易佣金会迅速增加。其次，还有其他交易成本需要考虑。
这些隐藏的成本本来只占股票价格的一小部分，但如果经常发生的话，这些成本加起来就很大了。最后，频繁交易可能缴纳更多的税，这会大大降低回报。（这段话我的
理解是频繁的股票交易会增加交易成本，从而降低投资回报，里面涉及的具体费率，笔者还是没有太清楚）

　　就像一个人可以成为一个伟大的赛车手而不需要是机械工程师一样，我们也可以成为一个伟大的投资者，但是我们不用太关心交易的底层是如何在市场上
进行的。这里的意思是，你不用关心交易的数据是如何从一个计算机系统流向另一个计算机系统的。

　　需要记住的是，投资就像象棋游戏，你的思考、耐心和对未来的观察能力最后都将获得回报。走正确的一步比迅速的走好几步更重要。
##投资就意味着拥有企业
　　就向上文中所表达的那样，股票的交易不是最重要的，那么什么才是最重要的呢？之前的文章中我们提到过:**当你购买股票时，你是在购买公司的所有权利益**。股票
不仅仅是用来交易的纸张，它意味着你是这个公司的股东，你拥有这个公司的股份。

So if you are buying businesses, it makes sense to think like a business owner. This means learning how to read financial 
statements, considering how companies actually make money, spotting trends, and figuring out which businesses have the best 
competitive positions. It also means coming up with appropriate prices to pay for the businesses you want to buy. Notice 
that none of this requires lightning-fast reflexes!

　　因此，如果你是在购买企业，那么像企业主一样思考是有道理的。这意味着学习如何阅读财务报表，考虑公司如何赚钱，发现趋势，以及确定哪些企业拥有最
具竞争力的职位。这也意味着为你想购买的企业提供合适的价格。注意，这一切都不需要闪电般的反应!

You should also buy stocks like you would any other large purchase: with lots of research, care, and the intention to 
hold as long as it makes sense. Some people will spend an entire weekend driving around to different stores to save $60 
on a television, but they put hardly any thought into the thousands of dollars they could create for themselves by 
purchasing the right stocks (or avoiding the wrong ones). Again, investing is an intellectual exercise, but one that 
can have a large payoff.
##You Buy Stocks, Not the Market
We've all seen the prognosticators on television, predicting where the market is going to go in the future. One thing to 
remember when listening to these market premonitions is that stock investing is about buying individual stocks, not the 
market as a whole. If you pick the right stocks, you can make money no matter what the broader market does.

Another reason to heavily discount what the prognosticators say is that correctly predicting market movements is nearly 
impossible. No one has done it consistently and accurately. There are simply too many moving parts, and too many unknowns. 
By limiting the field to individual businesses of interest, you can focus on what you can actually own while dramatically 
cutting down on the unknowns. You can save a lot of energy by simply tuning out market predictions.

We established in the previous lesson that stocks are volatile. Why is that? Does the value of any given business really 
change up to 50% year-to-year? (Imagine the chaos if the value of our homes changed this much!) The fact is,  "Mr. Market" 
tends to be a bit of an extremist in the short term, over-reacting to both good and bad news. We will talk more about 
this phenomenon later, but it is nevertheless a good fact to know when starting.
##Competitive Positioning Is Most Important
Future profits drive stock prices over the long term, so it makes sense to focus on how a business is going to generate 
those future earnings. Competitive positioning, or the ability of a business to keep competitors at bay, is the most 
important determining factor of future profits. Despite where the financial media may spend most of its energy, 
competitive positioning is more important than the economic outlook, more important than the near-term flow of news 
that jostles stock prices, and even more important than management quality at a company.

It may be helpful to think of the investing process as if you were planning a trip across the ocean. You cannot do 
anything about the current weather or the tides (the current economic conditions). You can try to wait out bad weather 
that might sink your ship, but then you are also giving up time. And as we've already covered, time is a precious 
resource in investing.

The main thing you can control is what ship to board. Think of the seaworthiness of a ship as the competitive positioning 
of a business, and the horsepower of the engine as its cash flow. Some ships have thick, reinforced metal hulls, while 
others have rotting wood. Clearly, you would pick the ships that are the most seaworthy (with the best competitive 
positioning) and have the most horsepower (cash flow).

Though the ship's captain (company management) certainly matters, the quality of the ship is more important. On a 
solid vessel, as long as the captain does not mess up, there is not much difference between a good and a great captain. 
Meanwhile, there is nothing the best skipper can do if the boat's engine is broken and the boat is constantly taking on 
water (poor business). To relate this to stocks, business economics trump management skill.

It's also worth noting that all ships will experience waves (volatility). And though it is true that a rising tide 
lifts all ships, the tides have nothing to do with the quality of the boats on the sea. All else equal, a better 
ship is still going to arrive faster, and a company with the best competitive positioning is going to create the most 
value for its shareholders. We will talk about exactly how to spot the best ships in later lessons.
##The Bottom Line
It is very easy for new stock investors to get started on the wrong track by focusing only on the mechanics of trading 
or the overall direction of the market. To get yourself in the proper mind-set, tune out the noise and focus on studying 
individual businesses and their ability to create future profits. In the coming lessons, we will begin to build the 
skills you will need to become a successful buyer of businesses.

#103: 长期投资
##简介
　　在上一篇文章中，我们学到了这样的知识：不同投资回报率之间几个百分点的差异会对未来的财富产生巨大的影响。这么说来，如果对股票进行长期投资，
那么他的回报是可能超过风险的。在这篇文章中我们将研究这种风险与回报的关系。
##Volatility of Single Stocks
　　就某一只股票而言他的价格往往波动很大，不同股票之间的回报率也可能相差很大。如果你投资了正确的股票，那毋庸置疑你当然可以赚很多钱。例如，
怪物能量饮料（Monster Energy）的股票（股票代码：MNST）。这只股票在2012年10月的10年回报率是所有股票中最高的。如果你在2002年投资了1万美元，
那么到2012年10月，你所获得的回报将超过200万美元！

　　看到上面的例子先别激动去买股票，因为股票投资的回报没有保证的，很有可能投资了一只股票最后赔的连底裤都不剩了。在21世纪初，有数百个互联网
投资公司破产的例子，在2008年金融危机期间，曾经传奇的雷曼兄弟公司（Lehman Brothers）倒闭，华尔街基石美林证券（Merrill Lynch）被收购。

　　在这两个极端之间是每日、每周、每月和每年波动的不同公司的股票价格。大多数股票在未来一年内不会翻倍，很多股票也不会跌到零。但是我们要考虑的是，
纽约证券交易所(New York stock Exchange)中不同的股票平均年收益之间最大相差接近40%。

　　对于某一只股票来说除了收益不稳定之外，还有一个风险是，这只股票的价值很可能不会随着时间的推移而大幅上涨。例如，J.C. Penney (JCP)股价
在过去三年里平均每年下跌超过7%，过去5年平均每年下跌13%，长期股东在过去15年平均每年下跌3%。相比之下，同期标准普尔500指数的平均年回报率为5%，
债券市场回报率为6%

　　显然，如果你把所有的鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里，篮子破了那么所有的鸡蛋都会碎掉。相反，如果篮子没问题，那基本上就相当于彩票中了大奖，你的财富将
大幅度的提升。
##股票市场的波动
	
One way of reducing the risk of investing in individual stocks is by holding a larger number of stocks in a portfolio. 
However, even a portfolio of stocks containing a wide variety of companies can fluctuate wildly. You may experience large 
losses over short periods. Market dips, sometimes significant, are simply part of investing in stocks.

For example, consider the Dow Jones Industrials Index, a basket of 30 of the most popular, and some of the best, companies 
in America. If during the last 100 years you had held an investment tracking the Dow, there would have been 10 different 
occasions when that investment would have lost 40% or more of its value.

The yearly returns in the stock market also fluctuate dramatically. The highest one-year rate of return of 67% occurred 
in 1933, while the lowest one-year rate of return of negative 53% occurred in 1931. It should be obvious by now that stocks 
are volatile, and there is a significant risk if you cannot ride out market losses in the short term. But don't worry; 
there is a bright side to this story.
##Over the Long Term, Stocks Are Best
Despite all the short-term risks and volatility, stocks as a group have had the highest long-term returns of any investment type. 
This is an incredibly important fact! When the stock market has crashed, the market has always rebounded. And over the very long term, 
stocks have outperformed bonds on a total real return (after inflation) basis, on average.

If you had deplorable timing and invested $100 into the stock market during any of the seven major market peaks in the 
20th century, that investment, over the next 10 years, would have been worth $125 after inflation, but it would have been 
worth only $107 had you invested in bonds, and $99 if you had purchased government Treasury bills. In other words, stocks 
have been the best-performing asset class over the long term, while government bonds, in these cases, merely kept up with inflation.
This is the whole reason to go through the effort of investing in stocks. Again, even if you had invested in stocks at 
the highest peak in the market, your total after-inflation returns after 10 years would have been higher for stocks than 
either bonds or cash. Had you invested a little at a time, not just when stocks were expensive but also when they were cheap, 
your returns would have been much greater.
##Time Is on Your Side
Just as compound interest can dramatically grow your wealth over time, the longer you invest in stocks, the better off you 
will be. With time, your chances of making money increase, and the volatility of your returns decreases.

From 1926-2011, the average annual return for the S&P 500 stock index (including reinvested dividends) for a single year 
has ranged from negative 43% to positive 54%, while averaging about 10%. Five-year average annualized returns have ranged 
from about negative 12% to positive 24%.

These returns easily surpass those you can get from any of the other major types of investments. Again, as your holding 
period increases, the expected return variation decreases, and the likelihood for a positive return increases. This is 
why it is important to have a long-term investment horizon when getting started in stocks.
##Why Stocks Perform the Best

While historical results certainly offer insight into the types of returns to expect in the future, it is still important 
to ask the following questions: Why, exactly, have stocks been the best-performing asset class? And why should we expect 
those types of returns to continue? In other words, why should we expect history to repeat?

Quite simply, stocks allow investors to own companies that have the ability to create enormous economic value. Stock 
investors have full exposure to this upside. For instance, in 1985, would you have rather lent Microsoft money at a 6% 
interest rate, or would you have rather been an owner, seeing the value of your investment grow several-hundred fold?

Because of the risk, stock investors also require the largest return compared with other types of investors before they 
will give their money to companies to grow their businesses. More often than not, companies are able to generate enough 
value to cover this return demanded by their owners.

Meanwhile, bond investors do not reap the benefit of economic expansion to nearly as large a degree. When you buy a bond, 
the interest rate on the original investment will never increase. Your theoretical loan to Microsoft yielding 6% would 
have never yielded more than 6%, no matter how well the company did. Being an owner certainly exposes you to greater risk 
and volatility, but the sky is also the limit on the potential return. 
##The Bottom Line
While stocks make an attractive investment in the long run, stock returns are not guaranteed and tend to be volatile in 
the short term. Therefore, we do not recommend that you invest in stocks to achieve your short-term goals. To be effective, 
you should invest in stocks only to meet long-term objectives that are at least five years away. And the longer you invest, 
the greater your chances of achieving the types of returns that make investing in stocks worthwhile.

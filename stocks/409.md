#409: 通过分红发现好公司
##简介

　　上节课，我们学习了股息如何为股票建立一个公司的内在价值，并作为对管理层资本配置实践的检查。在本节课中，我们将更详细地讨论如何识别具有良好总回报前景的高质量股票。

　　将总回报分解为当前收益率和预期股息增长，我们还应该把增长潜力分成两部分:公司核心业务的增长(假设是盈利增长，也就是说，所有的赌注都没有了)，以及任何剩余自由现金流支持的增长。我们将这个分为三部分的过程称为股息演练。

##考虑当期股息

　　如果我们能确定一只股票的当前股息是可持续的长期股息，我们就能得到该股票的当前收益率，瞧，我们总回报的一大块被计入其中。将股息视为理所当然意味着建立长期可持续性。没有什么是永恒的——问问曾经享有盛誉的固特异轮胎(Goodyear Tire GT)的股东就知道了——尽管通用电气(GE)等少数几只股票的股息记录非常接近不朽。

　　是什么建立了一个安全的股息?寻找可控的债务水平。记住，债券持有人和银行的薪酬高于股东。接下来，寻找一个合理的派息率，或股息占利润的百分比。低于80%的派息率是一个很好的经验法则。最后，寻找稳定的现金流。还需要一条经济护城河:没有护城河的公司往往是周期性的(想想汽车和化学品)，在不可避免的行业低迷时期，它们缺乏维持盈利的定价权。

　　可口可乐就是一个很好的例子。2005年年中，该公司的股票以45美元左右的价格易手，同时每年支付1.10美元的股息。当时，派息率合理(前12个月为52%)，现金实际超过债务(无债务担忧)，经营现金流保持稳定。最重要的是，可口可乐的护城河非常宽——可口可乐可以说是地球上最有价值的品牌，这是焦糖水的一大成就。

　　可口可乐当时的收益率为2.4%(合1.10美元/ 45美元)，这是预期总回报率的第一个组成部分。基于目前每股约2.00美元的盈利能力，我们将有0.90美元的留存收益来为股息增长提供资金，如前所述，股息增长有两种形式。

##评估公司的核心增长潜力

　　这种分析的一个关键是要了解为这种增长提供资金需要多少投资。市场中很少有爆满的领域，但随着美国经济的扩张(每年3%-4%，加上通货膨胀)和新兴市场的开放，随着时间的推移，大多数公司和行业至少有一定的增长潜力。通货膨胀也可能是一种推动力，尽管把制造业企业的价格上涨视为理所当然并不一定是个好主意。幸运的是，对于大多数成熟的企业来说，支持这一基本的增长水平相对便宜，因此回报也很高。

　　考虑增长成本的另一种通常更为简单的方法是将公司的自由现金流视为净收入的百分比。由于自由现金流包括支持增长计划的资本投资成本，因此收益和自由现金之间的差异让我们对增长成本有了一种感觉。

　　例如，假设自由现金流始终占净收入的60%左右，而销售和利润增长约为6%。这表明，只有40%的利润将支持这一增长，剩下的60%用于股息、债务削减、股票回购和其他非核心投资。

　　这一核心增长为我们提供了总回报方程的第二部分。对于可口可乐，我们假设未来5年营业收入增长5.2%，此后可口可乐的增长将明显低于这一数字。假设管理层维持当前的派息率，公司的总派息率应会以类似的速度增长。因此，我们将5.2%的增长锁定在预期总回报率上，将我们的预期(包括上面提到的2.4%的收益率)提高到7.6%。

But we've got one more task before moving on to the third and final step--how much will achieving this 5.2% growth cost? One of the simplest angles is to take the growth we expect (5.2%) and divide that by a representative return on equity (a nifty 30.8% for Coke in the past five years). The resulting ratio--call it "R-cubed" for "required retention ratio"--is the proportion of earnings used to fund core growth. For Coke, the R3 is 17% of income, or $0.34 per share.
Aftertax return on invested capital is also worth a look. ROIC is actually the purest way of analyzing the incremental cost of growth; in our formula ROIC replaces return on equity in the calculation of R3. However, ROIC is more complex to use, and it leaves out the company's capital structure (mix of additional borrowings and retained earnings) that is reflected in ROE. If the capital structure is stable and returns on equity are consistent--Coke checks out here on both counts--ROE is a good metric to use.
We'll stick with ROE R3, and estimate 5.2% annual growth will cost Coke $0.34 per share. Over time the absolute number will grow, but the proportion (17%) will remain the same as long as its two factors--growth and return on equity--stay the same.
Two thirds of the way through our analysis, we're up to a 7.6% return, and we still have $0.56 per share to spare ($2.00 in earnings less $1.10 for the dividend and $0.34 to fund core growth). So what's the final $0.56 per share worth?

Evaluate the "Excess" Earnings
After paying dividends and funding core growth, a company may have cash left over. It could opt to pay down debt, which would reduce interest expense and thus increase earnings. It might make an acquisition or some other investment, though the returns here could be spotty. Finally, it might opt to buy back stock.
Whatever the company decides to do with these excess funds, we put the result into the growth bucket of our prospective total return. In other words, we assume that any cash not used for a dividend is employed to create earnings and dividend growth. To get a proxy for the added growth potential of remaining earnings, we'll make an additional assumption that the path of least resistance is a share buyback.
This assumption is meant to err on the side of conservatism. The earnings yield (the inverse of P/E) on most stocks is generally much less than a company's return on equity, so we're not projecting much bang for this last slice of our buck. And acquisitions--returns of cash to someone else's shareholders--tend not to be priced for returns equal to existing investments.
Share buybacks boost earnings growth--EPS grows not only when the numerator (profit) expands, but also when the denominator (shares outstanding) shrinks. Dividing the excess earnings into the stock price gives us an "excess earnings yield," the third component of our total return calculation. So if Coke uses the last $0.56 of per-share earnings to repurchase stock, it will be able to retire 1.2% of its shares in the first year ($0.56 divided by a $45 share price). That, in turn, gives next year's earnings per share a 1.2% tailwind--even if earnings are flat, fewer shares outstanding mean higher earnings per share.

So What's It Worth?

Totaling Coke's yield (2.4%), profit growth (5.2%), and excess earnings yield (1.2%) produces an expected total return of 8.8%. It's important to note that this total return projection is contingent on the current stock price--we can expect an 8.8% annual return from Coke only if we acquire the shares at $45. If we pay less, our total return will be higher, and vice versa.
For example, let's say the market hits the proverbial banana peel, and Coke is offered at $35. Meanwhile our expectations (current earnings, dividend rate, future growth) haven't changed. Our core growth projection (5.2%) remains, but our two other factors are contingent on the stock price: At $35 the stock will yield 3.1% and our excess earnings quotient will rise to 1.6%. Our expected total return is now 9.9%, more than a full point higher. Conversely, if we wind up paying $55, our total return prospects are substantially reduced. Coke's yield will fall to 2%, the excess earnings quotient to 1.1%, and our expected return to 8.3%.
This analysis essentially calculates fair value in reverse--instead of using a required rate of return to yield a fair price for the stock, we use the stock price to calculate the shares' total return. Coke's fair value is the price at which its total return is equal to the return we would require for any stock of similar risk characteristics. Morningstar's fair value estimate in mid-2005 for Coke was $54, which was calculated using an 8.5% cost of equity--a return virtually identical to our total return projection if we use $54 as the stock's price.
What's the "right" required rate of return? Unfortunately there's more art than science to this, but we have two observations. First, over a very long period of time (200 years), the market has managed to return something around 10%. Lower-risk stocks would offer less, while higher-risk situations should require more. But most established, dividend-paying companies would fall in a range between 8% and 12%. Whatever you determine a "fair" return to be, demand more. This way you have a margin of safety between your assumptions and subsequent realities.
The Bottom Line
This analysis is not suited to every stock or situation. For one thing, even with the surge in the popularity of dividends in recent years, less than half of U.S. stocks pay a dividend. It's also not particularly well suited to deeply cyclical firms, whose earnings power and even dividend rates will vary widely from year to year. It's also not suited for emerging-growth stories. But for the ranks of relatively consistent, mature, moat-protected stocks--of which there are hundreds, if not thousands to pick from--we can use the dividend as a critical selection tool.

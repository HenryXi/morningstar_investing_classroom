#305: 量化竞争优势
##介绍

　　决定一个公司是否有经济护城河当然更多的是艺术而不是科学。它主要涉及到影响竞争定位的定性因素。但是，我们在第205和206课中提到的那些定性因素，实际上可以通过分析财务报表中的特定数字来衡量。最明智的做法是确保你感兴趣的公司在购买前确实有护城河。在这节课中，我们将告诉你要找什么。

##自由现金流

　　强大的自由现金流是公司拥有护城河的一个标志，只要现金流来自于持续经营而不是一次性事件。记住，自由现金流代表的是公司已经重新投资其业务以维持其运营后剩下的资金。它通常定义为营运现金流减去资本支出(两项措施都在现金流量表上找到)。如果一家公司的自由现金流占销售额的比例超过5%，你可能已经找到了一台自动取款机，并有了深入挖掘的良好基础，看看这家公司是否有一条经济护城河。

##利润率

　　请记住，我们可以衡量三种主要的利润率:毛利率、运营和净值。这三种方式分别是毛利、营业利润和净收入占销售额的百分比。简而言之，利润率告诉你一个公司每一美元的销售额能带来多少利润。

　　有经济头脑的公司通常比竞争对手有更大的利润率，这应该是有道理的。沃尔玛(Wal-Mart WMT)可能会以与当地杂货店相同的价格出售一个苹果。但如果沃尔玛的成本降低，那么它出售苹果的利润率就会更高。同样，哈雷-戴维森(Harley-Davidson HOG)和它的竞争对手之一制造一辆摩托车的成本可能也一样，但哈雷应该能够以更高的价格出售它的自行车，因为它的品牌。哈雷会有更高的利润率。

　　超过15%的净利润率是一个很好的基准，经常表明公司具有持续的竞争优势。但是，请记住，利润本身的用处是有限的;您还必须考虑营业额和退货的背景，我们稍后将对此进行讨论。

##营业额

　　营业额衡量的是一家公司如何有效地利用其资产进行销售。有几种类型的营业额可以用来衡量效率，但是也许我们这里讨论的最相关的是总资产周转率，或者销售额除以总资产。在其他条件相同的情况下，一家营业额高于竞争对手的公司效率更高，可能具有某种优势。

　　与利润空间一样，单独考虑一家公司的营业额能提供的信息是有限的。最好是比较同一行业公司的营业额。同样，营业额通常应该在利润率和回报率的上下文中使用。

##净资产收益率

　　记住，股本回报率(ROE)衡量的是股东在公司投资的资本的每一美元的利润。与此同时，资产回报率(ROA)衡量的是同样的东西，但衡量的是整个资产基础，而不仅仅是股权。

　　两者都是衡量公司整体盈利能力的好指标。拥有护城河的公司通常会比竞争对手有更高的回报。

　　大多数行业都可以使用两种不错的回报率基准:如果一家公司的回报率超过10%，或一段时间内其回报率超过15%，那么这家公司可能确实拥有一条护城河。

##杜邦方程

　　我们已经提到，利润率和周转率本身并不重要，应该与其他非常相似的公司的利润率和周转率进行比较。有一个方程，所谓的杜邦方程，可以把所有的概念联系起来。杜邦方程简单地分解了ROA和ROE的成分。您可能还记得ROA的以下公式(为了简单起见，我们将忽略税后利息支出)。
Return on Assets = Net Profits / (Average Assets)
But we can also express ROA this way:
Return on Assets = (Asset Turnover) x (Net Profit Margin)
If we break this equation down further by defining turnover and margin, we can see why this works--sales in the definitions of turnover and margin cancel each other out.
ROA = ((Sales) / (Average Assets)) x ((Net Profits) / (Sales))
=
(Net Profits) / (Average Assets)
We aren't just doing random algebra for fun here. Rather, this highlights the two different ways a company can create high returns for itself. Companies can either use their assets more efficiently to generate sales, or they can have higher profit margins, or both.

Margin vs. Turnover
Let's look at the two ways--margin and turnover--that a company can create high returns for itself. Thanks to the several types of moats it possesses, Microsoft (MSFT) is incredibly profitable, with gross profit margins around 80% and net profit margins around 23%. This means for every dollar of sales it generates, its cost of goods sold is only $0.20. Meanwhile, even after all overhead expenses and taxes, it still generates $0.23 in bottom-line profit per dollar of sales.
But Microsoft does not turn over its assets very effectively, having a total asset turnover of only 0.6. Part of this is because a large chunk of its assets are represented by a giant cash hoard that is not generating anything but mere interest income. As such, Microsoft's ROA is "only" 14%.
Wide-moat retailer Wal-Mart (WMT) is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Its net profit margin is only 3.5%, about one-seventh that of Microsoft. However, it turns its assets over 2.4 times. As a result, its ROA is a little over 8% (3.5% times 2.4).
Of course, companies that can create both high profit margins and turnover can generate exceptionally strong returns. Weight Watchers International (WTW) has 17% net profit margins and asset turnover of 1.64, for an ROA of more than 25%--a testament to the firm's wide economic moat.

DuPont and ROE

To use the DuPont equation to calculate a company's ROE, we have to add a step to the process to account for the amount of leverage (debt) a company employs. We can break down ROE using the DuPont equation as follows:
ROE = ROA x (Asset / Equity Ratio)
ROE = (Asset Turnover) x (Net Profit Margin) x (Asset / Equity Ratio)
ROE = (Sales / Average Assets) x (Net Profits / Sales) x (Average Assets / Average Equity)
=
(Net Profits) / (Average Equity)
Notice that in the ROE breakdown, both sales and average assets cancel each other out.
One can draw the same insights about operating efficiency (profit margins) and asset use efficiency (turnover) as with ROA, but this adds the element of leverage to the equation. Clearly, companies can use leverage (debt) in order to boost their ROEs.
Return on Invested Capital
The best way to determine whether or not a company has a moat is to measure its return on invested capital (ROIC). This is similar to ROA but is a bit more involved. The upshot is it gives the clearest picture of exactly how efficiently a company is using its capital, and whether or not its competitive positioning allows it to generate solid returns from that capital.
ROIC = (Net Operating Profit After Taxes--NOPAT) / (Invested Capital--IC)
Notice the numerator is a nonstandard measure, meaning you will not find it on any standard financial statement. We have to calculate it ourselves. The name "net operating profit, after taxes" is fairly descriptive, but you can also think about NOPAT as simply net income with interest expense (net of taxes) added back. We do this to figure out what the profit would be without taking a company's capital structure into consideration.
NOPAT = (Operating Profit) x (1 - Tax Rate)
For the denominator, invested capital is yet another nonstandard, calculated measure not found on any financial statement. Invested capital tries to measure exactly how much capital is required to operate a business. It can be defined as such:
IC = (Total Assets) - (Excess Cash) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities)
This equation introduces two new terms that need some explanation. Excess cash can be defined as the cash a company has that is not required to operate the business. For example, Microsoft clearly does not need the full $35 billion in cash and investments it has in its war chest to keep the business running, and we can subtract a portion of that cash because that capital is not really invested in the business.
The most salient example of a non-interest-bearing current liability is accounts payable. The reason we subtract accounts payable from the invested capital base is because, if you think about it, accounts payable represent capital invested in the business by a company's suppliers, not the company itself. Other forms of liabilities that we should probably subtract out are deferred revenues and deferred taxes. (We say "probably" because, like excess cash, determining what liabilities do and do not represent invested capital requires a lot of judgment.)
Once you have a gone through the exercise of calculating an ROIC for a company, how do you know if it has a wide moat? Typically, if a company has an ROIC in excess of 15% for a number of years, it most likely has a moat. That said, whether a company is creating value depends on whether its ROIC exceeds its cost of capital. We will explain cost of capital in detail in Lesson 403.

The Bottom Line
Figuring out whether or not a company has an economic moat remains largely a qualitative exercise, but the numbers should confirm your observations. Companies with wide economic moats should have strong free cash flow and handsome returns on invested capital.

#304: 解释这些数字
##介绍

　　在前面的三个课程中，我们分别讨论了三个主要的财务报表。你了解了损益表的不同组成部分，以及如何确定一家公司是否盈利。我们讨论了资产、负债和股东权益之间的区别以及在资产负债表上的位置。最后，我们审视了现金流量表，以计算公司在经营、投资和融资活动中使用或赚取了多少现金。

　　但既然你对每一份财务报表都有了这些了解，作为投资者，你该如何利用它们呢?

　　在这节课中，我们将把你到目前为止学到的知识应用到一个叫做财务报表分析的过程中。财务报表分析通常通过财务比率来解释财务报表中不同数字之间的重要关系。财务报表和比率分析的最终目的是帮助你解释这些数字，并对公司的财务表现和状况有一个清晰的了解。

　　在我们开始之前，我们应该通知您以下比率仅适用于非金融公司。金融公司，如银行或保险公司，具有独特的特点。因此，他们的财务报表看起来与其他大多数公司不同。

##如何使用财务比率

　　我们在前面的课中已经提到了这里提到的一些比率，但是本节课将给你一个全面的关于最重要的数字的介绍。有些比率本身是有用的。如果不考虑上下文，其他的是完全没用的。通常情况下，与其他相同比率相比，财务比率提供了最大的收益。

　　关于公司的比率主要在两个维度中使用:不同时间和自身比较和同一时间和其他公司比较。对一家公司进行长期的比较是确定公司发展趋势的一个很好的方法。如果某些比率正在稳步改善，这可能表明公司的经营状况或财务状况有所改善;相反，如果某些比率看起来越来越糟，它可能会凸显公司的一些令人不安的前景.

　　将一家公司的比率与业内其他公司的比率进行比较也很重要。一家公司的比率可能会随着时间的推移而不断提高，但它们与同行的比率相比又如何呢?如果他们不像竞争对手那样乐观的话，这可能表明这家公司的地位和管理不如其他行业公司那么好。

　　在晨星公司，我们在进行分析时评估许多比率。我们考虑的四种主要类型是效率、流动性、杠杆和利润率。当我们描述每个类别中的一些主要比率时，我们将讨论每个类别试图度量的比率以及其中的变化可能表明的比率。

##效率比

　　无论一家公司从事何种业务，它都必须投资于资产以执行其业务。效率比率衡量的是公司如何有效地利用这些资产，以及它如何管理其负债。

　　**库存周转率**。库存周转率显示了公司如何管理库存水平。如果存货周转率过低，说明一家公司可能库存过多或库存积压过多，或者可能在向客户销售产品时遇到问题。其他条件相同，库存周转率越高越好。

　　库存周转率 = (销售成本) / (平均库存)

　　**应收账款周转率**。应收账款周转率衡量的是公司信用政策的有效性。如果应收账款周转率太低，这可能表明该公司太过慷慨地提供信贷，或者难以从客户那里收取款项。其他条件均相同，较高的应收账款周转率较好。

　　应收账款周转率 = 收入 / 平均应收账款

　　**应付账款周转率**。您将注意到，应付账款周转率使用的是方程中的负债而不是资产，以及费用而不是收入。应付账款周转率很重要，因为它衡量的是公司如何管理自己的账单。高应付账款周转率可能是一个信号，表明公司没有从自己的供应商那里得到非常优惠的付款条件。在其他条件相同的情况下，较低的应付周转率更好。

　　应付账款周转率 = 销售成本 / 平均应付账款

　　**总资产周转率**。总资产周转率(Total asset turnover)是一个包罗万象的效率比率，突显出管理在利用短期和长期资产方面的有效性。其他条件相同，总资产周转率越高越好。

　　总资产周转率 = 收入 / 平均总资产

##流动比率

　　简而言之，公司的流动性是其履行短期债务的能力，也是衡量财务健康状况的主要指标。流动性可以通过几个比率来衡量。
Current ratio. The current ratio is the most basic liquidity test. It signifies a company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. A current ratio greater than or equal to one indicates that current assets should be able to satisfy near-term obligations. A current ratio of less than one may mean the firm has liquidity issues.
Current Ratio = (Current Assets) / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio. The quick ratio is a tougher test of liquidity than the current ratio. It eliminates certain current assets such as inventory and prepaid expenses that may be more difficult to convert to cash. Like the current ratio, having a quick ratio above one means a company should have little problem with liquidity. The higher the ratio, the more liquid it is, and the better able the company will be to ride out any downturn in its business.
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Short-Term or Marketable Securities) / (Current Liabilities)
Cash Ratio. The cash ratio is the most conservative liquidity ratio of all. It only measures the ability of a firm's cash, along with investments that are easily converted into cash, to pay its short-term obligations. Along with the quick ratio, a higher cash ratio generally means the company is in better financial shape.
Cash Ratio = (Cash + Short-Term or Marketable Securities) / (Current Liabilities)
Leverage Ratios
A company's leverage relates to how much debt it has on its balance sheet, and it is another measure of financial health. Generally, the more debt a company has, the riskier its stock is, since debtholders have first claim to a company's assets. This is important because, in extreme cases, if a company becomes bankrupt, there may be nothing left over for its stockholders after the company has satisfied its debtholders.
Debt/Equity. The debt/equity ratio measures how much of the company is financed by its debtholders compared with its owners. A company with a ton of debt will have a very high debt/equity ratio, while one with little debt will have a low debt/equity ratio. Assuming everything else is identical, companies with lower debt/equity ratios are less risky than those with higher such ratios.
Debt/Equity = (Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt) / Total Equity
Interest Coverage. If a company borrows money in the form of debt, it most likely incurs interest charges on it. (Money isn't free, after all!) The interest coverage ratio measures a company's ability to meet its interest obligations with income earned from the firm's primary source of business. Again, higher interest coverage ratios are typically better, and interest coverage close to or less than one means the company has some serious difficulty paying its interest.
Interest Coverage = (Operating Income) / (Interest Expense)
Profitability Ratios
How good is a company at running its business? Does its performance seem to be getting better or worse? Is it making any money? How profitable is it compared with its competitors? All of these very important questions can be answered by analyzing profitability ratios.
Gross Margin. You'll recall from our earlier discussion of the income statement that gross profit is simply the difference between a company's sales of goods or services and how much it must pay to provide those goods or services. Gross margin is simply the amount of each dollar of sales that a company keeps in the form of gross profit, and it is usually stated in percentage terms. The higher the gross margin, the more of a premium a company charges for its goods or services. Keep in mind that companies in different industries may have vastly different gross margins.
Gross Margin = (Gross Profit) / (Sales)
Operating Margin. Operating margin captures how much a company makes or loses from its primary business per dollar of sales. It is a much more complete and accurate indicator of a company's performance than gross margin, since it accounts for not only the cost of sales but also the other important components of operating income we discussed in Lesson 301, such as marketing and other overhead expenses.
Operating Margin = (Operating Income or Loss) / Sales
Net Margin. Net margin considers how much of the company's revenue it keeps when all expenses or other forms of income have been considered, regardless of their nature. While net margin is important to take note of, net income often contains quite a bit of "noise," both good and bad, which does not really have much to do with a company's core business.
Net Margin = (Net Income or Loss) / Sales
Free Cash Flow Margin. In Lesson 303, we discussed the concept and importance of free cash flow. The free cash flow margin simply measures how much per dollar of revenue management is able to convert into free cash flow.
Free Cash Flow Margin = (Free Cash Flow) / Sales
Return on Assets (ROA). Return on assets measures a company's ability to turn assets into profit. (This may sound similar to the total assets turnover ratio discussed earlier, but total assets turnover measures how effectively a company's assets generate revenue.)
Return on Assets = (Net Income + Aftertax Interest Expense) / (Average Total Assets)
You'll notice that we are adding back the company's aftertax interest expense to net income in the calculation. Why is that? Return on assets measures the profitability a company achieves on all of its assets, regardless if they are financed by equity holders or debtholders; therefore, we add back in what the debtholders are charging the company to borrow money.
Why are we adding interest back in on an "aftertax" basis? Interest expense is one of the many line items that are either added to or subtracted from revenue to calculate the pretax income amount. This pretax income amount is then taxed to come up with net income. Thus, when the income-reducing effect of interest expense is ultimately filtered down to net income, it is on an aftertax basis.
A company's aftertax interest expense is easy to determine. First, determine its tax rate by dividing its income tax expense by its pretax income. Then plug that figure into the following formula:
Aftertax Interest Expense = (1 - Tax Rate) x (Interest Expense) 
Return on assets is generally stated in percentage terms, and higher is better, all else equal.
Return on Equity (ROE). Return on equity is a straightforward ratio that measures a company's return on its investment by shareholders. Like all of the profitability ratios we've discussed, it is usually stated in percentage terms, and higher is better.
Return on Equity = (Net Income) / (Average Shareholders' Equity)
The Bottom Line
In this lesson, we began to apply what we had learned about the financial statements in the previous three lessons. We talked about the use of financial ratios and the importance of considering them in a comparative context. We covered several types of ratios, including efficiency, liquidity, leverage, and profitability ratios. By studying the concepts outlined above and completing the exercises that follow, you'll be well on your way toward understanding how to interpret a company's financial statements and analyzing a company for investment purposes.

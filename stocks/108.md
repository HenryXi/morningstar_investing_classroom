#108: 学习术语-基本比率
##简介
　　既然你已经了解了阅读财务报表(商业语言)的基本知识，让我们学习一下投资的基本语言。

　　比率是投资者用来将股票价格与公司业绩相关联的常用工具。只要你意识到它的局限性，这些不太靠谱的比率就可以以它们自己的方式发挥作用。

　　但是在计算任何比率之前，我们必须先讨论一些基本的定义。
##每股收益
　　每股收益(EPS)是一个公司一段时间内(通常是指过去的12个月)的净收入除以其发行的股票数量。EPS有两种，基本的和稀释的。基本每股收益只包括公司股票的实际流通股，而稀释后的每股收益是指将净收入除以所有可能的股票(这里译者的理解是有些股票还为成为正式股票)。稀释后的每股收益是比较保守的数字。

每股收益 = 总收入 / 流通股

　　虽然每股收益可以帮助我们快速了解公司的盈利能力，但我们不应只关注它而不考虑现金流和其他业绩指标。
##市值
　　市值是公司的市场价值。它是通过将流通股数量乘以当前股价来计算的。例如，如果ABC公司股票目前有1000万股，每股25美元，那么ABC的市值就是2.5亿美元。我们很快就会发现，市值的概念不仅能体现的公司规模，也会在计算基本估值比率时使用。

　　市值=（股价）x（股票发行量）

##利润率
　　就像有三种利润(毛利、经营和净盈利)一样也会有三种利润率.通过利润率可以计算出公司的盈利能力。利润率通常以百分比表示。

　　毛利率 = 毛利 / 收入

　　营业利润率 = 营业利润 / 收入

　　净利润率 = 净利润 / 收入
##价格/收益(市盈率)和相关比率
　　最受欢迎的估值方法之一是市盈率或称之为P/E。P/E是股票的价格除以这个股票接下来的四个季度时间里的收益。举例来说，在过去一年中一只股票交易价格为15美元，每股收益为1美元,那么它的市盈率就是15.

　　市盈率 = 股票价格 / 股票年收益

　　市盈率给投资者提供了一个粗略地计算股票的购买价格和其收益之间比例的概念。这种方法可以快速但不精确的来衡量一个股票的贵贱。一般来说，市盈率越高，越多的投资者就愿意投资这家公司以获得收益。高市盈率的股票(通常是市盈率在30以上的股票)往往具有较高的增长率或预期的盈利好转。与此同时，低市盈率的股票(通常是市盈率低于15的股票)往往会有较慢的增长或较低的未来前景。

　　通过比较同类公司的市盈率可以看出竞争对手的积累情况。此外，你可以将a公司的市盈率与标准普尔500指数的平均市盈率或其他一些基准指数进行比较，以大致了解这只股票相对于整体市场的估值有多高。

　　市盈率的一个有用的变体是收益率，即每股收益除以股票价格。 收益率是市盈率的倒数，因此高收益率表示相对便宜的股票，而低收益率表示更昂贵的股票。 将收益率与10年或30年期国债收益率进行比较对帮助我们更好的了解股票的价格。

　　收益率 = 1 / 市盈率 = 每股收益 / 股票价格

　　P/E的另一个有用的变体是PEG比(市盈增长比率)。一般来说，高市盈率意味着市场预期公司的利润未来会迅速增长，因此未来公司潜在收益比例将更高。这意味着它的市场价值(市场价值反映了公司未来的收益)相对于它现在的收益来说是巨大的。

　　PEG比(市盈增长比率)可以帮助你确定股票的市盈率是否过高，从而让你知道投资者为公司的增长支付了多少钱。根据华尔街的估计，在未来5年里，股票的PEG比率是其预期市盈率除以预期收益增长的结果。例如，如果一家公司的远期市盈率为20，其年收益平均每年增长10%，其PEG率(市盈增长比率)为2.0。再者，PEG率(市盈增长比率)越高，股票的价格就越高。

　　PEG(市盈增长比率) = 未来预期市盈率 / (企业盈利年增长比率 * 100)

　　与其他测量标准一样，应该谨慎使用PEG(市盈增长比率)。PEG依赖于两个不同的华尔街分析估算——明年的收益和5年的盈利增长——因此，可能会出现过于乐观或悲观的分析。在零增长或高增长公司的极端情况下，PEG也就不准了。
##Price/Sales Ratio
The price/sales (P/S) ratio is figured the same way as P/E, except with a company's annual sales as the denominator instead of its earnings. An advantage to using the P/S ratio is that it is based on sales, a figure that is much harder to manipulate and is subject to fewer accounting estimates than earnings. Also, because sales tend to be more stable than earnings, P/S can be a good tool for screening cyclical companies and other companies with fluctuating earnings patterns.

P/S = (Stock Price) / (Sales Per Share) = (Market Capitalization) / (Total Sales)

When using the P/S ratio, it is important to keep in mind that a dollar of earnings has essentially the same value regardless of the level of sales needed to create it. Meaning, a dollar of sales at a highly profitable firm is worth more than a dollar of sales for a company with narrow profit margins. This means comparing price/sales is generally useful only when comparing companies in similar industries.

To understand the differences across industries, let's compare grocery stores with the medical-device industry. Grocery stores tend to have very small profit margins, earning only a few pennies on each dollar of sales. As such, grocers have an average P/S ratio of 0.5, one of the lowest in Morningstar's coverage universe. It takes a lot of sales to create a dollar of earnings at a grocery store, so investors do not value those sales dollars very highly.

Meanwhile, medical-device makers have much fatter profit margins. Relative to the grocer, it does not take nearly as much in sales for a medical-device company to create a dollar in earnings. It is little wonder the device makers have a high average price/sales ratio of 5.0. A grocer with a P/S ratio of 2.0 would look quite expensive while a medical-device maker with the same P/S could be dirt-cheap.
##Price/Book Ratio
Another common valuation measure is the price/book ratio (P/B), which relates a stock's market value with its book value (also known as shareholder equity) from the latest balance sheet. Book value can be thought of as what would be left over for shareholders if a company shutters operations, pays off its creditors, collects from its debtors, and liquidates itself.

Book Value Per Share = (Total Shareholders Equity) / (Shares Outstanding)

P/B = (Stock Price) / (Book Value Per Share) = (Market Capitalization) / (Total Shareholder Equity)

As with the other ratios we've covered so far, there are caveats to using P/B. For instance, book value may not accurately measure a company's worth, especially if the firm possesses significant intangible assets such as brand names, market share, and other competitive advantages. The lowest price/book ratios tend to be in capital-intensive industries such as utilities and retail, whereas the highest P/B ratios are in fields such as pharmaceuticals and consumer products, where intangibles are more important.

Price/book is also tied to return on equity (ROE), which is net income divided by shareholder equity. Given two companies that are otherwise equal, the one with the higher ROE will have a higher P/B ratio. A high P/B shouldn't be cause for alarm, especially if the company continually earns a high ROE.
##Price/Cash Flow
The price/cash flow (P/CF) ratio is not as commonly used or as well known as the other measures we've discussed. It's calculated similarly to P/E, except that it uses operating cash flow instead of net income as the denominator.

P/CF = (Stock Price) / (Operating Cash Flow Per Share)

Cash flow can be less subject to accounting shenanigans than earnings because it measures actual cash, not paper or accounting profits. Price/cash flow can be helpful for firms such as utilities and cable companies, which can have more cash flow than reported earnings. Price/cash flow can also be used in place of P/E when there are so many one-time expenses that reported earnings are negative.
##Dividend Yield
There are two ways to make money when buying a stock--capital gains (when a stock goes up in price) and dividend payments. Dividends are payments that companies make directly to shareholders.

Dividend yield has been an important measure of valuation for many years. The dividend yield is equal to a company's annual dividend per share divided by its stock price per share. So, if a company pays an annual dividend of $2.00 and has a stock that trades for $100, its dividend yield is 2.0%. If that same stock's price fell to $50 per share, its dividend yield would rise to 4.0%. Conversely, all else equal, the dividend yield falls when a stock's price goes up.

Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividends Per Share) / (Stock Price)

Stocks with high dividend yields are generally mature companies with few growth opportunities. The economic reasoning behind this is that these companies can't find enough promising projects to invest in for future growth, so they pay a larger portion of profits back to shareholders. While utility companies are considered the typical dividend-paying stocks, you can also find dividends in sectors with lots of room left for growth such as the pharmaceutical industry.

Dividends have recently begun to garner investors' attention again. A big driver of this new focus was a recent change in the United States tax code that lowered the tax rate on dividends. So if you are looking for dividend income from your stock investments, remember that the best high-yielding stocks have strong cash flows, healthy balance sheets, and relatively stable businesses. And, if you're relying on that stream of dividends for income, checking for a steady history of dividend payments is also a good idea.
##The Bottom Line
We've gone over how to calculate a lot of ratios in this lesson, but understanding the components of these ratios is key to learning the lingo of investors. It is also essential in beginning to understand when a stock is cheap or expensive. The good news is that if you invest long enough, the ratios highlighted here will become second nature.

#204: 开始像分析师一样思考
##简介

　　投资不仅仅是学习基本的会计和分析金融报告;它也与观察我们周围的世界有关。它是关于认识趋势以及这些趋势最终在美元方面意味着什么。

　　像分析师一样思考可以有所帮助，因为它可以提供一些有组织的方式来观察世界。我们都有分析能力，但这些能力的发展程度取决于个人。磨练你的分析能力可以帮助你组织那些每天让你不知所措的信息.

　　例如，我们很难不注意到快餐店是如何相互靠近的。也许这是一个显而易见的问题，但为什么呢?显然，这些位于堪萨斯州中部50英里的唯一出口的餐馆没有太多选择，当然，商业和住宅区划法规在一定程度上规定了地点。但是，为什么所有的速食店在有其他选择的时候都在彼此附近呢?毕竟，这些餐厅集中在一起有什么好处呢?如果温蒂(温)就在麦当劳隔壁，麦当劳会发生什么?

##四个基本的问题

　　对于餐馆或任何企业来说，这些问题的答案可以通过提出四个非常普遍的问题来启动分析过程:

    1. 企业的目标是什么?
    
    2. 企业如何赚钱?

    3. 公司的实际经营状况如何?

    4. 相对于竞争对手，公司的定位有多好?

　　一旦你开始思考这些术语，并提高你的观察力，你就会像分析师一样思考，不断寻找投资机会。

　　例如，餐馆的目标就是为顾客提供食物。这似乎相当简单——尽管一些餐厅也试图将餐饮与娱乐结合起来，以达到喜忧参半的效果——但不要想当然地认为企业的目的是显而易见的。确保你对它真正想要达到的目标有一个很好的了解。然后，问一下这个企业是否有必要努力实现这个目标。举例来说，餐馆是否需要通过娱乐的方式让顾客开心?

　　一旦你对公司想要做的事情有了很好的了解，想想它是如何赚钱的。在我们的餐馆例子中，餐馆里的食物实际上要花多少钱?这家餐厅会因为环境宜人或提供娱乐而对食物收费更高吗?这家餐厅是想薄利多销，还是试图少卖，但利润却高得多?

　　然后问自己，“这个行业做得怎么样?”现在不要担心收到任何财务报表;相反，专注于观察你对公司的看法。回到我们的餐馆例子，想想你选择在哪里吃饭，为什么。你最喜欢的地方有多久了?你最喜欢的餐厅有很多个吗?这些餐厅是门庭若市吗?它们的位置好吗?他们有很多回头客吗?他们是否有更优秀的员工?内饰有多花哨?作为这个或类似行业的潜在投资者，所有这些都很重要。

　　如果您认为您对业务的表现有很好的理解，作为一个观察者您可以花一些时间来考虑它在行业中的运行情况。换句话说，评估竞争。

　　这个行业竞争激烈吗?对于餐馆来说，当然有很多选择，但是一个完全不同的行业呢，比如电脑?计算机公司的种类和餐馆一样多吗?绝对不可能的。这是否意味着计算机行业的竞争力不如餐饮业?不一定,相反，这可能意味着竞争的方式非常不同。既然开办一家电脑公司需要大量的资金，而开办一家餐厅则不需要那么多资金，那么也许电脑制造业的风险更大?也许找到新产品也更困难?也许在这个行业中唯一的竞争方式就是价格?问这些问题可以让你很好地了解一个特定的企业在应对可能遇到的挑战时所处的位置.

　　在这一点上，我们可能会觉得有点疯狂，但像分析师一样思考，需要观察商业世界，并提出问题来理解它是如何运作的。值得庆幸的是，也有一些专家已经做了很多这样的思考，他们中的许多人已经开发了有用的框架来帮助我们组织更多的思考。

　　如果我们回想一下前面提到的四个问题，我们应该能够很好地理解一个企业的目标和业绩，只要阅读它并研究它的财务报表。还有最后一个问题需要思考，那就是一家公司相对于竞争对手的定位有多好，在思考这个问题的时候我们可能需要更多的帮助。

##找到一个结构:护城河

　　用一个典型的与英国和中世纪有关的形象来分析股票显得有点奇怪。正如我们已经看到的，要想真正像分析师一样思考，考虑数字之外的因素是很重要的。毕竟，我们的目标是找到表现出色的优秀公司，在这种情况下，我们可能需要付出额外的努力来寻找“圣杯”。

　　一个有用的概念是“经济护城河”。虽然你可能不会经常听到像市盈率或营业利润这样的术语，但经济护城河的概念应该是股票分析和估值的指导原则之一。最终，这个想法可能会获得更多的追随者，因为我们认为，它是识别那些长期创造股东价值的公司的基础。与此同时，我们只是觉得自己很幸运，因为我们拥有一套方法可以将真正伟大的公司与仅仅优秀的公司区分开来。

##什么是经济护城河

　　简单地说，经济护城河是一种长期的竞争优势，它可以让公司长期获得超额利润。这个术语是由我们最喜欢的投资者之一沃伦·巴菲特创造的，他意识到，长期回报投资者的公司具有持久的竞争优势。评估这种优势需要了解公司能够在自己的行业中为自己建立什么样的防御或竞争壁垒。

　　从投资的角度来看，护城河是很重要的，因为只要一家公司开发出一种有用的产品或服务，其他公司很快就会通过生产一种类似(如果不是更好的话)的产品来抓住这个机会。基本经济理论认为，在一个完全竞争的市场中，竞争对手最终会吃掉一个成功企业赚取的任何超额利润。换句话说，竞争使得大多数公司在很长一段时间内很难产生强劲的增长和利润，因为任何优势都有可能被模仿。

　　一个公司的经济护城河的强度和可持续性将决定该公司是否能够阻止竞争对手抢走业务或侵蚀其收益。在我们看来，拥有广泛经济领域的公司最适合长期将竞争对手挡在门外，但我们也用“狭窄”和“无”来描述公司的领域。我们不经常谈论护城河的深度，但这是一种很好的方式来思考一个公司可以利用它的优势赚多少钱。

　　要确定一家公司是否有经济护城河，遵循以下四个步骤:

1. Evaluate the firm's historical profitability.Has the firm been able to generate a solid return on its assets and on shareholder equity? This is probably the most important component to identifying whether or not a company has a moat. While much about assessing a moat is qualitative, the bedrock of analyzing a company still relies on solid financial metrics.
2. Assuming that the firm has solid returns on its capital and is consistently profitable, try to identify the source of those profits. Is the source an advantage that only this company has, or is it one that other companies can easily imitate? The harder it is for a rival to imitate an advantage, the more likely the company has a barrier in its industry and a source of economic profit.
3. Estimate how long the company will be able to keep competitors at bay.
We refer to this time period as the company's competitive advantage period, and it can be as short as several months or as long as several decades. The longer the competitive advantage period, the wider the economic moat.
4. Think about the industry's competitive structure. Does it have many profitable firms or is it hypercompetitive with only a few companies scrounging for the last dollar? Highly competitive industries will likely offer less attractive profit growth over the long haul.
Types of Economic Moats
    
    After researching hundreds of companies, we've identified four main types of economic moats.

    Low-Cost Producer. Companies that can deliver their goods or services at a low cost, typically due to economies of scale, have a distinct competitive advantage because they can undercut their rivals on price.

    Wal-Mart (WMT) is a great example of a low-cost producer, and its low costs allow it to price its products the most attractively. As a dominant player in retailing, the company's size provides it with enormous scale efficiencies, or operating leverage, that it uses to keep costs low. Scale allows Wal-Mart to do its own purchasing more efficiently since it has roughly 5,000 large stores worldwide, and it gives the company tremendous bargaining power with its suppliers. Since the company positions itself as a low-cost retailer, it wants to ensure it gives the lowest prices to its customers. This can translate into tough bargaining terms for those firms that want to sell their products on Wal-Mart's shelves. As a result, Wal-Mart is able to offer prices that competitors have a difficult time matching--one reason why you don't see too many Kmarts around anymore.

    High Switching Costs. Switching costs are those one-time inconveniences or expenses a customer incurs in order to switch over from one product to another. If you've ever taken the time to move all of your account information from one bank to another, you know what a hassle it can be--so there would have to be a really good reason, like a package deal on an account and mortgage for example, for you to consider switching again.

    Companies aim to create high switching costs in order to "lock in" customers. The more customers are locked in, the more likely a company can pass along added costs to them without risking customer loss to a competitor.

    Surgeons encounter these switching costs when they train to do procedures using specific medical devices, such as the artificial joint products from medical-device companies Zimmer (ZMH) or Stryker (SYK). After training to learn to use a specific product, switching to another would require the surgeon to forgo comfort and familiarity--and what patient, much less surgeon, would want that? Additionally, because the surgeon would have to be trained to use a new, competing product, he or she would also have to contend with lost time and money resulting from not performing as many surgical procedures. Clearly, with certain products and services, the switching costs can be quite high.

    The Network Effect. The network effect is one of the most powerful competitive advantages, and it is also one of the easiest to spot. The network effect occurs when the value of a particular good or service increases for both new and existing users as more people use that good or service.

    For example, the fact that there are literally millions of people using eBay makes the company's service incredibly valuable and all but impossible for another company to duplicate. For anyone wanting to sell something online via an auction, eBay (EBAY) provides the most potential buyers and is the most attractive. Meanwhile, for buyers, eBay has the widest selection. This advantage feeds on itself, and eBay's strength only increases as more users sign on.

    Intangible Assets. Some companies have an advantage over competitors because of unique nonphysical, or "intangible," assets. Intangibles are things such as intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, and copyrights), government approvals, brand names, a unique company culture, or a geographic advantage.

    In some cases, whole industries derive huge benefits from intangible assets. Consumer-products manufacturers are one example. They build profits on the power of brands to distinguish their products. Well-known PepsiCo (PEP) is a leader in salty snacks and sports drinks, and the firm boasts a lineup of strong brands, innovative products, and an impressive distribution network. The company's investment in advertising and marketing distinguishes its products on store shelves and allows PepsiCo to command premium prices. Consumers will pay more for a bag of Frito-Lay chips than for a bag of generic chips. As the value of a brand increases, the manufacturer is also often able to be more demanding in its distribution relationships. To a large degree, brand power creates demand for those chips and secures their placement on store shelves.

    One final thought about economic moats: It is possible for some companies to have more than one type of moat. For example, many companies that use the network effect also benefit from economies of scale, because these companies tend to grow so large that they dwarf smaller competitors. In general, the more types of economic moat a company has--and the wider those moats are--the better.
    The Bottom Line
    Successful long-term investing involves more than just identifying solid businesses, or finding businesses that are growing rapidly, or buying cheap stocks. We believe that successful investing also involves evaluating whether a business will stand the test of time.
    Moats are a useful framework to help answer this question. Identifying a moat will take a little more effort than looking up a few numbers, but we think understanding a company's competitive position is an important process for determining its long-term profitability. And as we stated earlier in this book, how well a company's stock performs is directly related to the profits the firm can generate over the long haul.

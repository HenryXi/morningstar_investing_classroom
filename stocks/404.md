#404: 将DCF付诸行动
##简介

　　现在我们已经涵盖了贴现现金流量（DCF）模型的总体工作以及我们如何在晨星公司处理它们，我们将深入探讨如何确定股票的公允价值。 在本课中，我们将引导您逐步使用“自由现金流到权益”方法的DCF模型。 以下是使用此方法生成每股公允价值估计的主要步骤：

* 步骤1.预测期间的自由现金流量。
* 步骤2.确定折扣率。
* 步骤3.将预计的自由现金流量折扣到现在，并计算总和。
* 步骤4.计算永久值并将其折扣到现在。
* 步骤5.添加步骤3和4中的值，并按未完成的份额除以总和。

　　步骤1.预测现金流

　　预测未来现金流的第一步是了解过去。这意味着要查看公司过去四五年的收入状况、资产负债表和现金流量表的历史数据。

　　一旦您检查了历史数据并将其输入电子表格程序，就可以在接下来的几年内详细预测公司的自由现金流。 这些预测是任何DCF模型的核心。 他们将依赖于您对公司及其竞争地位的了解，以及您对未来事物将如何发展的看法。 如果您认为利润率会扩大，或者销售增长将大幅减缓，或者公司需要增加资本支出来维持其设施，那么您的预测应该反映这些预测。

　　接下来，我们需要估计公司的“永续年份”。 在这一年，我们认为我们无法再充分预测未来的自由现金流。 我们还需要对该公司当年的自由现金流量进行预测。

　　首先，假设虚构的公司Charlie's bicycle去年产生了5亿美元的自由现金流。我们还假设Charlie目前的自行车系列非常畅销，公司预计在未来五年的自由现金流将以每年15%的速度增长。五年后，我们认为竞争对手将开始抄袭查理的设计，侵蚀查理的发展。因此，五年后，自由现金流的年增长率将降至5%。我们的自由现金流预测是这样的:
```
去年:500.00美元
第一年:575.00
第二年:661.25
第3年:760.44
第四年:874.50
第五年:1005.68
第六年:1055.96
第7年:1108.76
第八年:1164.20
第9年:1222.41
第10年:1283.53
```
Step 2--Determine a Discount Rate
Because we're using the "free cash flow to equity" method of DCF, we can ignore Charlie's cost of debt and WACC in coming up with a discount rate. Instead, we'll focus on coming up with an assumed cost of equity, using the principles highlighted in the previous lesson.
Charlie's has been in business for more than 60 years, and it has not had an unprofitable year in decades. Its brand is well-known and respected, and this translates into very respectable returns on its invested capital. Given this and the relatively stable outlook for Charlie's profits, settling for a 9% cost of equity (lower than average) seems appropriate given the modest risks Charlie's faces.

Step 3--Discount Projected Free Cash Flows to Present
The next step is to discount each of the individual year's cash flows to express them in terms of today's dollars. Remember we are using the following formula, and the "discount factor" just represents the denominator in the equation. We can then multiply each year's cash flow by the discount factor to get the present value of each cash flow.
Present Value of Cash Flow in Year N =
CF at Year N / (1 + R)^N
CF = Cash Flow
R = Required Return (Discount Rate), in this case 9%
N = Number of Years in the Future
Last Year: $500.00
Year 1: 575.00 x (1 / 1.09^1) = 528
Year 2: 661.25 x (1 / 1.09^2) = 557
Year 3: 760.44 x (1 / 1.09^3) = 587
Year 4: 874.50 x (1 / 1.09^4) = 620
Year 5: 1005.68 x (1 / 1.09^5) = 654
Year 6: 1055.96 x (1 / 1.09^6) = 630
Year 7: 1108.76 x (1 / 1.09^7) = 607
Year 8: 1164.20 x (1 / 1.09^8) = 584
Year 9: 1222.41 x (1 / 1.09^9) = 563
Year 10: 1283.53 x (1 / 1.09^10) = 542
We then add up all the discounted cash flows from Years 1 through 10, and come up with a value of $5,870 million ($5.87 billion).

Step 4--Calculate Discounted Perpetuity Value

In this step, we use another formula from the last lesson:
Perpetuity Value =
( CFn x (1+ g) ) / (R - g)
CFn = Cash Flow in the Last Individual Year Estimated, in this case Year 10 cash flow
g = Long-Term Growth Rate
R = Discount Rate, or Cost of Capital, in this case cost of equity
For example, we'll use use 3% as the perpetuity growth rate, which is close to the historical average growth rate of the U.S. economy. So, we'll assume that after 10 years, Charlie's Bicycles will also grow at this 3% rate. Plugging the numbers into the formula:
( $1,284 x (1 + .03) ) / (.09 - .03) = $22,042 million
Notice that for the cash flow figure we used the undiscounted Year 10 cash flow, not the discounted $542 million. But because we used the undiscounted amount, we still need to express the perpetuity value in present-value terms using this trusty formula:
Present Value of Cash Flow in Year N =
CF at Year N / (1 + R)^N
Present Value of Perpetuity Value =
$22,042 million / (1 + .09)^10 = $9,311 million
Step 5--Add It All Up

Now that we have the value of all the cash flows from Year 1 through 10 as well as those from Year 11 on, we add up these two values:
Discounted Free Cash Flow, Years 1-10: $5,870 million
+ Discounted Free Cash Flow, Years 11 on: $9,311 million
which equals $15,181 million.
So there we have it! We have estimated Charlie's Bicycles to be worth $15.2 billion. The final, simple step is to divide this $15.2 billion value by the number of shares Charlie's Bicycles has outstanding. If Charlie's has 100 million shares outstanding, then our estimate of Charlie's intrinsic value is $152 per share.
If Charlie's stock is trading at $100 per share, you should start to get interested in buying the shares. We can forget about what Charlie's P/E ratio is relative to its peers as well as what Wall Street analysts have recently said about the stock. The bottom line is the stock is trading below its estimated intrinsic value. If you have confidence in your free cash flow projections, you can have an equal amount of confidence in buying the stock.
The Bottom Line
As you may tell, this is merely a simple example of how to use a DCF model, but it's still not exactly "simple." Not many people put this much work into their investments. But if you're willing to go through the effort of creating a DCF model for a company you are interested in, you will be much more informed and confident than the vast majority of other investors.
There are numerous small twists that the other type of DCF model (cash flow to the firm) uses, but the output should be approximately the same no matter which DCF method you use for a given firm. Also keep in mind that a model does not need to be super-complex to get you most of the way there and help you clarify your thinking. Remember, using a similar DCF model can take you a long way in finding superior companies trading at a discount to their intrinsic value--the key to a profitable long-term investing strategy.

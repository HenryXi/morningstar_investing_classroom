#107:介绍财务报表
##简介
　　尽管“财务报表”和“会计”这类的商业语言足以让许多人望而却步，但在购买股票之前你还是需要知道这一点商业语言的。你不需要成为一个注册会计师就能理解三个最基本也是最重要的财务报表:损益表、资产负债表和现金流量表。在公司的年度报告、10-K和10-Q文件中都可以找到这三种报表。

　　财务报表是了解公司业绩和健康状况的窗口。我们将在本课中对每个财务报表提供一个非常基本的概述，并在第301-303课中详细说明。

##损益表
　　损益表是什么，我为什么要关注它？

　　损益表告诉你一个公司的收入(它的收入)，它花了多少钱(它的花费)，以及两者之间的差额(它的利润)。损益表会显示一个公司在一段时间内的收入和支出，这段时间一般是三个月或一年。这份报表包含了你在媒体或财务报告中经常看到的信息——如总收入、净收入或每股收益。

　　损益表回答了这样一个问题:“这个公司的业绩表现如何?”简而言之就是回答这个问题，“它赚钱吗?”一个公司必须能够带来比它所花费的更多的钱，否则从商业角度来说它不会存活很长时间的。收入不变的情况下，越低的开销意味着越高的利润，这种公司尤其值得投资，因为公司的收入中大部分直接给股东带来收益。

**收入，支出和利润**

　　下面将逐个描述收益表中的这三个主要的部分。

　　收入:收入部分通常是损益表中最简单的部分。尽管大公司有时会以提供更多信息的方式(例如，按地理位置或业务部门划分)来划分收入，但通常情况下只y用一个数字来代表公司在特定时间段内带来的所有资金。收入通常也被称为销售额。

　　支出：尽管支出类型很多，但最常见的两种是销售成本和销售总务管理支出（销售，管理以及行政）费用。 销售成本也被称为售出商品成本，是创造收入最直接的成本。 例如，Gap GPS公司可能会花10美元制作一件衬衫，它的售价为15美元,那么我们认为该衬衫的销售成本就是10美元.也就是说公司为了能够买这件衬衫将投入10美元的资金进行生产。 销售，管理以及行政费用通常也被称为营业费用。这种费用包括运营业务的大部分其他成本，包括市场营销，管理工资和技术支出。

　　利润:简单来说，利润等于总收入减去总费用。有几个常用的利润的子类别投资者应该了解下。毛利等于收入减去销售成本。它基本上显示出，在完成销售后，剩下多少钱用来支付运营费用(以及用来给股东带来多少利润)。以我们之前的Gap衬衫为例，出售这件衬衫的毛利将是5美元(15美元的销售价格——10美元的销售成本= 5美元的毛利)。营业利润等于收入减去销售成本和销售总务管理支出。这个数字代表公司从实际运营中获得的利润，不包括那些可能与主要业务无关的某些支出和收入。净利润通常代表公司的利润，包括财务费用在内的所有费用都已支付。这个数字通常被称为“账本底线”，通常是指人们在使用“利润”或“收益”时所指的数字。

##资产负债表
　　资产负债表是什么?为什么我们要关注它?

　　资产负债表，也被称为财务状况表，主要告诉你一个公司拥有多少资产(它的资产)，以及它欠多少钱(有多少负债)。它所拥有的和它所欠的钱之间的差额就是它的净值，也就是通常所说的“净资产”，“股东权益”或“净值”。

　　资产负债表为投资者提供了一个公司健康状况的快照，就像财务报表上提供的日期一样。一般来说，如果一个公司的资产多于负债，那么就说明它的状况很好。相反，就像你会小心翼翼地借钱给一个背负着巨额债务的朋友一样，投资一个有大量负债公司的时候应该更仔细地对其进行审查。

Assets, Liabilities, and Equity

Each of the three primary elements of the balance sheet is described below.

Assets. There are two main types of assets: current assets and noncurrent assets. Within these two categories, there 
are numerous subcategories, many of which will be explained in Lesson 302. Current assets are likely to be used up or 
converted into cash within one business cycle--usually defined as one year. For example, the groceries at your local 
supermarket would be classified as current assets because apples and bananas should be sold within the next year. Noncurrent 
assets are defined by our left-brained accountant friends as, you guessed it, anything not classified as a current 
asset. For example, the refrigerators at your supermarket would be classified as noncurrent assets because it's 
unlikely they will be "used up" or converted to cash within a year.

Liabilities. Similar to assets, there are two main categories of liabilities: current liabilities and noncurrent 
liabilities. Current liabilities are obligations the firm must pay within a year. For example, your supermarket may 
have bought and received $1,000 worth of eggs from a local farm but won't pay for them until next month. Noncurrent 
liabilities are the flip side of noncurrent assets. These liabilities represent money the company owes one year or more 
in the future. For example, the grocer may borrow $1 million from a bank for a new store, which it must pay back in five years.

Equity. Equity represents the part of the company that is owned by shareholders; thus, it's commonly referred to as 
shareholder's equity. As described above, equity is equal to total assets minus total liabilities. Although there are 
several categories within equity, the two biggest are paid-in capital and retained earnings. Paid-in capital is the 
amount of money shareholders paid for their shares when the stock was first offered to the public. It basically 
represents how much money the firm received when it sold its shares. Retained earnings represent the total profits 
the company has earned since it began, minus whatever has been paid to shareholders as dividends. Since this is a 
cumulative number, if a company has lost money over time, retained earnings can be negative and would be renamed "accumulated deficit." 
##The Statement of Cash Flows
What is it and why do I care?

The statement of cash flows tells you how much cash went into and out of a company during a specific time frame such 
as a quarter or a year. You may wonder why there's a need for such a statement because it sounds very similar to the 
income statement, which shows how much revenue came in and how many expenses went out.

The difference lies in a complex concept called accrual accounting. Accrual accounting requires companies to record 
revenues and expenses when transactions occur, not when cash is exchanged. While that explanation seems simple enough, 
it's a big mess in practice, and the statement of cash flows helps investors sort it out.

The statement of cash flows is very important to investors because it shows how much actual cash a company has 
generated. The income statement, on the other hand, often includes noncash revenues or expenses, which the statement 
of cash flows excludes.

One of the most important traits you should seek in a potential investment is the firm's ability to generate 
cash. Many companies have shown profits on the income statement but stumbled later because of insufficient cash 
flows. A good look at the statement of cash flows for those companies may have warned investors that rocky times 
were ahead.

The Three Elements of the Statement of Cash Flows

Because companies can generate and use cash in several different ways, the statement of cash flows is separated 
into three sections: cash flows from operating activities, from investing activities, and from financing activities.

The cash flows from operating activitiessection shows how much cash the company generated from its core business, 
as opposed to peripheral activities such as investing or borrowing. Investors should look closely at how much cash 
a firm generates from its operating activities because it paints the best picture of how well the business is producing 
cash that will ultimately benefit shareholders.

The cash flows from investing activitiessection shows the amount of cash firms spent on investments. Investments are 
usually classified as either capital expenditures--money spent on items such as new equipment or anything else needed 
to keep the business running--or monetary investments such as the purchase or sale of money market funds.

The cash flows from financing activitiessection includes any activities involved in transactions with the company's 
owners or debtors. For example, cash proceeds from new debt, or dividends paid to investors would be found in this section.

Free cash flow is a term you will become very familiar with over the course of these workbooks. In simple terms, it 
represents the amount of excess cash a company generated, which can be used to enrich shareholders or invest in new 
opportunities for the business without hurting the existing operations; thus, it's considered "free." Although there 
are many methods of determining free cash flow, the most common method is taking the net cash flows provided by 
operating activities and subtacting capital expenditures (as found in the "cash flows from investing activities" 
section).

Cash from Operations - Capital Expenditures = Free Cash Flow
##The Bottom Line
Phew!!! You made it through an entire lesson about financial statements. While we're the first to acknowledge that 
there are far more exciting aspects about investing in stocks than learning about accounting and financial 
statements, it's essential for investors to know the language of business. We also recommend you sharpen your newfound 
language skills by taking a good look at the more-detailed discussion on financial statements in Lessons 301-303.

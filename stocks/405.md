#405: Fat-Pitch策略
##简介

　　在棒球比赛中，一名击球手如果在好球区内看到三球经过，就会被裁判员叫出场外。而且，正如许多棒球迷所知道的，从一个裁判到下一个裁判的好球带可以是不同的大小。因此，棒球运动员出于害怕被叫出场外，常常有一种动力去挥击他们不愿挥击的球。

　　许多投资者，尤其是专业的基金经理，把投资当成一场棒球比赛。因为职业基金经理的目标是打败对手的指数，所以他们感到有很大的压力，为了保住自己的投资，他们必须打出本垒打、二垒安打、三垒安打和全垒打。因为害怕被“呼出”，他们可能会在好球区内挥棒，即使他们可能更喜欢看那些球经过。换句话说，投资者往往会忘记他们的估值原则，把投资当成一场棒球比赛——三次三振出局。所以他们走开了。

　　但是如果棒球的规则不同呢?如果击球手可以看到任意数量的球经过，等待完美的“胖球”出现，然后再挥棒呢?当然，棒球永远不会采用这条规则——比赛将会持续太久，投手们会抱怨他们的时代在不断升级。但作为投资者，你可以(也应该)遵守这些规则。

　　你可以通过等待投手来显著提高你的投资打击率。市场——把你扔到好球带的中间。除非市场投出一个你非常有信心的球，否则你可以站在一边，看着一个接一个的好球被投出，而不用担心被喊出来，因为与棒球不同，耐心投资是没有惩罚的。随着市场的变化，你可以让任意数量的弧线球、指节球和滑块通过，直到你看到你想要击打的那一个。

　　在晨星定义的Fat-Pitch策略里有五部分:

##寻找宽护城河公司

　　正如我们在前面的课程中所描述的那样，拥有广阔经济护城河的公司位于利润丰厚的行业，与竞争对手相比具有长期的结构性优势。这些公司有着可预测的收益、高于资本成本的资本回报和长期的持久力。

　　宽护城河公司的美妙之处在于，公司的实际内在价值很可能会随着时间的推移而增加，从而导致更高的股东价值。换句话说，时间是站在你这一边的。相比之下，没有经济护城河的公司通常会随着时间的推移破坏股东价值——当你购买一家没有护城河的公司时，你是在做一种投机性的押注，即该公司股票的反弹时间刚好够你卖掉它。这是一场非常艰难的比赛，通常只有经验丰富的职业球员才应该尝试。

##总是要留有安全的余地

　　与其根据其他人的行为来购买股票，不如只在股票以合理的安全边际卖出时才购买。甚至不要考虑股票市场的总体方向，因为这是不可能以任何一致性来预测的。通过这样做，你需要锻炼自己的纪律性，并克服害怕错过市场反弹的心理。在使用这种方法时，耐心确实是一种美德，因为通常情况下，可能需要好几个月，甚至更长时间，才会出现一个fat-pitch的机会。

　　尽管有时你可能会觉得市场正在远离你，而且你可能永远也不会听到一个响亮的口号，但请放心，未来会有机会的，你将随时准备离开。只考虑个别的宽护城河公司;如果你发现它的价格相对于其长期内在价值处于不合理的低位，考虑购买它。如果不是，那就等待一个更大的时机。

　　显然，要确定某只股票的交易是否有足够的安全边际，你必须对你认为这只股票的价值有某种估计。这个投资课堂系列的课程已经给了你足够的信息，你应该开始能够对股票进行估值。我们鼓励你反复练习，以磨练你的评估技能。
Also, you must determine how much of a margin of safety you'll require before buying a stock. If the firm is not very risky, you could be content with a 15%-20% discount to its fair value. If the firm is riskier than average, you may demand a 30%-40% discount. Ultimately, it's your decision.
　　
The beauty of fat-pitch investing is that it has two built-in factors that help offset the risk that your fair value estimate is wrong. First, by requiring a margin of safety, you've given yourself some "error cushion," just in case your estimate was too high. Second, by purchasing wide-moat companies, chances are high that the firm will increase in value over time. Thus, even if your estimates were way off, the firm--and its stock price--will likely appreciate in value, eventually catching up to your fair value estimate. In effect, by buying wide-moat companies, you have another margin of safety built into your investment.
Don't Be Afraid to Hold Cash
Holding cash is like holding an option--the option to take advantage of volatility in the market. The value of this option rises when market volatility rises. Thus, when the volatile stock market provides you an opportunity to buy wide-moat companies at bargain prices, you'll be ready with cash in hand to take advantage of the irrationality.
Many market participants often neglect this important aspect of investing and stay fully invested at all times. For instance, many professionals getting paid to invest other people's money feel they are actually required to stay fully invested even if there's a lack of fat-pitch opportunities. Thus, when the market drops, they often can't do anything but watch (or worse, sell out near the bottom).
Being fully invested at all times goes hand-in-hand with the professional's focus on relative returns--beating an index. For example, if the market drops by 10% in a year, but the fictional Relative Return Fund dropped only by 8%, Relative Return's manager has provided value because the fund had a better return relative to the market. However, had you invested in this fund, you'd still be 8% poorer, not exactly anything to cheer about.
We argue that individual investors should care more about absolute returns (how much money did you make) and less about relative returns (did you beat a benchmark). So if the market isn't throwing you fat pitches, just hold on to your cash and wait until it does, because fat-pitch investments are much more likely to provide strong absolute returns over time.

Don't Be Afraid to Hold Relatively Few Stocks
There are very few good ideas in any given year--Warren Buffett has said he's happy to have even one. For the rest of us (i.e., those without the need to invest several billion dollars to make a difference in their portfolios), there may be five or six good ideas a year. In any event, if you feel the need to hold more than 20 stocks, you probably aren't using the fat-pitch approach--more than likely you're speculating and trying to diversify away the risks of your speculations by holding lots of different names. Remember, it takes great patience to be a fat-pitch investor, but when opportunities present themselves (nice fat pitches right down the middle), you should buy boldly (swing away).
We caution you, however, that it's risky to hold a concentrated portfolio (few positions) unless you do three things:
1. Buy only wide-moat companies, which will increase in intrinsic value over time.
2. Buy them only at a significant discount to fair value (a margin of safety).
3. Have a time horizon of at least three years on each pick you make. It may take this long (or longer) for the market to recognize the value of a company.
If you aren't willing to follow these three rules on each and every stock you buy, then you probably need more diversification in your portfolio. (We'll talk much more about portfolio construction in Lesson 501.)

Don't Trade Very Often

If you're using the fat-pitch approach, you won't need to trade very often because you'll hold only wide-moat companies. By definition, a wide-moat company has long-term advantages and creates shareholder value year-in and year-out. Because a wide-moat firm creates value each year, its fair value tends to increase over time. These are the only types of stocks in which a buy-and-hold strategy works well, because the odds are in your favor that the actual underlying value will continue increasing over time. As we mentioned earlier, when you buy a company with no moat, you are making a bet that it will bounce up just long enough for you to sell it.
Think of it this way: Investing is nothing more than a game of probabilities. No matter how diligent you are, your fair value estimate for a stock will never be exactly right. It's really just an estimate of what a stock is worth under the most likely scenario for future earnings growth and profitability. Thus, there's always less than a 100% probability that you'll be right about a stock pick. Given that the odds are below 100%, there's little point in trading from one stock to another frequently; your odds of being "right" on the new pick are probably only a little higher than the odds of being wrong on the current pick.
Add to this the costs of trading--including taxes, bid-ask spreads, and commissions--and the odds of generating higher returns by trading frequently are worse than simply buying great stocks at good prices and holding them for three years or more. 
The Bottom Line
By following the fat-pitch approach to stock investing, we think you can tremendously improve your odds of investment success. Although it requires plenty of discipline and patience, you should be able to earn strong returns over the long term by buying only those stocks that present a nice fat-pitch opportunity.

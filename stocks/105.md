##105:公司的宗旨
##简介
　　当你持有一个公司股票的时候，你就是这个公司的股东，而作为股东应该了解这个公司的相关业务的财务状况。在本小节中将介绍如何了解一个公司财务状况的。

　　公司的主要目的是从投资者(债权人和股东)那里获得投资，并为他们的投资产生利润。债权人和股东在投资的过程中承担着不同的风险，因此他们将获得不同的
回报。债权人承担的风险较低，并且不论公司的表现如何(除非公司违约)，都将获得固定的收益。而对股东而言他将承担所有的风险，他们所获得回报的多少
取决于公司经营业绩。当企业产生大量利润时，股东们获得的收益也将变大。

　　就像我们在第101节学到的那样，投资者有很多投资渠道；他们可以将自己的资金投资于储蓄账户、政府债券、股票或其他投资工具。在每一项投资中，
投资者都希望获得投资回报。投资者购买股票代表了他们拥有公司的所有权利益，他们同时也希望公司可以为他们创造更多的价值，这样他们的收益才会变多。
##钱进钱出
　　公司可以为投资者带来回报，与此同时公司的运作和业务的发展都需要投资者的钱。投资者把钱(称为资本)投资到一家公司让其运作和发展业务，同样的
公司也有责任为投资者创造利润。利润与资本的比率称为资本回报。这里需要注意的是我们要注重回报率而不是回报的绝对值。

　　举例来说，一家公司在某一年的利润可能达到10亿美元，但这一目标可能花费了200亿美元来实现的，因此资本回报率仅为5%，这说明此公司并不太值得
投资。另一家公司可能只获得1亿美元的利润，但只花费了5亿美元就实现了，资本回报率为20%，这样看这家公司就值得投资。20%的资本回报率意味着投资者
每投入公司1美元，每年的收益为0.20美元。
##两种类型的资本
　　在进一步讨论资本回报率之前，我们应该首先明确对于公司来说有两种不同类型的资本。正如我们上面提到的，一个是将钱借给公司然后等待收取利息的人，我们称之为:债权人；
另一个是将钱投资到公司中的人，我们称之为：股东(“公司的所有者”)。债权人为公司提供债务资本，股东为公司提供股权资本。

　　一般来说债权人通常是银行、债券持有人或供应商。他们将钱借给公司以换取固定收益的债务资本回报，通常这些回报是以利息的方式支付的。当然最后公司
需要将本金一并偿还给债权人。

　　将钱借给公司的利率一般会高于政府债券的利率，因为公司通常会有较高的违约风险。贷方通常要求其贷款的回报与个人公司相关的风险相称。因此，一个稳定的公司会以较低的
利率借入资金(较低的利息支付)，但高风险的企业将不得不支付更高的利息(更高的利息)。

　　为公司提供股本的股东通常是银行、共同基金或对冲基金，以及私人投资者。他们把钱给一家公司，以换取对该业务的所有权利益。与债权人不同，股东没有
固定的投资回报，因为他们是公司的股东。当一家公司向公众出售股份时(换句话说，“上市”是“公开交易”)，它实际上是在出售自己的股权，而不是承诺
每年支付一定数量的股份。

　　公司在支付了员工、供应商、贷款机构之后，如果还有利润，那么股东有权获这些利润。你持有的股票越多，你获得的利润和潜在股息也就越高。所有者拥有潜在的无上限的利润，但如果公司经营不善倒闭了，股东也可能失去全部资金。

　　同样重要的是，要记住一个公司在任何特定时间内的股票总数。对于一个价值十亿的公司来说占有100股份中的一股比100万股份中占有100股要多，前者是1%后者是0.01%。
##当利润被创造的时候……
　　公司通常以分红的形式支付利润，或者将赚取的利润重新投入到业务发展当中。分红可以为股东提供现金，收益再投资为股东提供了未来获得更多利润的机会。许多公司，特别是年轻的公司，不会分红。他们将赚取的利润全部都投入到他们的业务发展当中。

One of the most important jobs of any company's management is to decide whether to pay out profits as dividends or to 
reinvest the money back into the business. Companies that care about shareholders will reinvest the money only if they 
have promising opportunities to invest in--opportunities that should earn a higher return than shareholders could get 
on their own.
　　任何公司管理层最重要的工作之一就是决定是将利润作为股息支付还是将钱重新投入到业务中。 关心股东的公司只有在有前途投资机会的情况下才会进行再投资 - 这些机会应该可以获得比股东可以获得的更高回报。
##Different Capital, Different Risk, Different Return

Debt and equity capital each have different risk profiles. Therefore, as we showed in Lesson 103, each type of capital 
offers investors different return opportunities. Creditors shoulder less risk than shareholders because they are accepting 
a lower rate of return on the debt capital they supply to a company. When a company pays out the profits generated each 
year, creditors are paid before anyone else. Creditors can break up a company if it does not have sufficient money to 
cover its interest payments, and they wield a big stick. 

Consequently, companies understand that there is a big difference between borrowing money from creditors and raising 
money from shareholders. If a firm is unable to pay the interest on a corporate bond or the principal when it comes due, 
the company is bankrupt. The creditors can then come in and divvy up the firm's assets in order to recover whatever they 
can from their investments. Any assets left over after the creditors are done belong to shareholders, but often such 
leftovers do not amount to much, if anything at all.

Shareholders take on more risk than creditors because they only get the profits left over after everyone else gets paid. 
If nothing is left over, they receive nothing in return. They are the "residual" claimants to a company's profits. 
However, there is an important trade-off. If a company generates lots of profits, shareholders enjoy the highest returns. 
The sky is the limit for owners and their profits. Meanwhile, loaners keep receiving the same interest payment year 
in and year out, regardless of how high the company's profits may reach. By contrast, owners keep whatever profits are 
left over. And the more that is left over, the higher their return on capital.
##Return on Capital and Return on Stock
The market often takes a long time to reward shareholders with a return on stock that corresponds to a company's return 
on capital. To better understand this statement, it is crucial to separate return on capital from return on stock. 
Return on capital is a measure of a company's profitability, but return on stock represents a combination of dividends 
and increases in the stock price (better known as capital gains). The two simple formulas below outline the return 
calculations in more detail:

Return on Capital: Profit / (Invested Capital)

Return on Stock: Shareholder Total Return = Capital Gains + Dividends

The market frequently forgets the important relationship between return on capital and return on stock. A company can 
earn a high return on capital but shareholders could still suffer if the market price of the stock decreases over the 
same period. Similarly, a terrible company with a low return on capital may see its stock price increase if the firm 
performed less terribly than the market had expected. Or maybe the company is currently losing lots of money, but 
investors have bid up its stock in anticipation of future profits.

In other words, in the short term, there can be a disconnect between how a company performs and how its stock performs. 
This is because a stock's market price is a function of the market's perception of the value of the future profits a 
company can create. Sometimes this perception is spot on; sometimes it is way off the mark. But over a longer period 
of time, the market tends to get it right, and the performance of a company's stock will mirror the performance of the 
underlying business.
##The Voting and Weighing Machines
The father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, explained this concept by saying that in the short run, the market is 
like a voting machine--tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is like a 
weighing machine--assessing the substance of a company. The message is clear: What matters in the long run is a company's 
actual underlying business performance and not the investing public's fickle opinion about its prospects in the short run.

Over the long term, when companies perform well, their shares will do so, too. And when a company's business suffers, 
the stock will also suffer. For example, Starbucks (SBUX) has had phenomenal success at turning coffee--a simple product 
that used to be practically given away--into a premium product that people are willing to pay up for. Over time, Starbucks 
has enjoyed handsome growth in number of stores, profits, and share price. Starbucks also has a respectable return on 
invested capital of over 20%.

Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) has languished. It has had a difficult time competing with discount stores and strip malls, 
and it has not enjoyed any meaningful profit growth in years. Plus, its return on invested capital rarely tops 10%. 
As a result, its stock has bounced around without really going anywhere in decades.
##The Bottom Line
In the end, stocks are ownership interests in companies. We can't emphasize this fact enough. Being a stockholder is 
being a partial owner of a company.
Over the long term, a company's business performance and its stock price will converge. The market rewards companies 
that earn high returns on capital over a long period. Companies that earn low returns may get an occasional bounce in 
the short term, but their long-term performance will be just as miserable as their returns on capital. The wealth a 
company creates--as measured by returns on capital--will find its way to shareholders over the long term in the form 
of dividends or stock appreciation.

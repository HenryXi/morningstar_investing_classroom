##105:公司的宗旨
##简介
	
It's worth repeating that when you hold a stock, you own part of a company. Part of being an owner is understanding the 
financial underpinnings of any given business, and this lesson will provide an introduction. 

The main purpose of a company is to take money from investors (their creditors and shareholders) and generate profits 
on their investments. Creditors and shareholders carry different risks with their investments, and thus they have different 
return opportunities. Creditors bear less risk and receive a fixed return regardless of a company's performance (unless 
the firm defaults). Shareholders carry all the risks of ownership, and their return depends on a company's underlying 
business performance. When companies generate lots of profits, shareholders stand to benefit the most.

As we learned in Lesson 101, at the end of the day, investors have many choices about where to put their money; they 
can invest it into savings accounts, government bonds, stocks, or other investment vehicles. In each, investors expect 
a return on their investment. Stocks represent ownership interests in companies that are expected to create value with 
the money that is invested in them by their owners.

　　当你持有股票的时候，你拥有公司的一部分，这是值得重复的。作为所有者的一部分是了解任何给定业务的财务基础，这一课将提供一个介绍。

　　公司的主要目的是从投资者(债权人和股东)那里获取资金，并从他们的投资中获得利润。债权人和股东在投资中承担着不同的风险，因此他们有不同的
回报机会。债权人承担的风险较低，且不论公司的表现如何(除非公司违约)，获得固定收益。股东承担所有的所有权风险，他们的回报取决于公司的基本
经营业绩。当企业产生大量利润时，股东们将受益最大。

　　就像我们在第101课上学到的那样，在一天结束的时候，投资者有很多选择去哪里投资;他们可以将其投资于储蓄账户、政府债券、股票或其他
投资工具。在每一项投资中，投资者都希望获得投资回报。股票代表所有权利益的公司预计将创造价值的钱投资于他们的主人。
##钱进钱出
Companies need money to operate and grow their businesses in order to generate returns for their investors. Investors 
put money--called capital--into a company, and then it is the company's responsibility to create additional money--called profits--for investors. 
The ratio of the profit to the capital is called the return on capital. It is important to remember that the absolute level of profits 
in dollar terms is less important than profit as a percentage of the capital invested. 

For example, a company may make $1 billion in profits for a given year, but it may have taken $20 billion worth of capital 
to do so, creating a meager 5% return on capital. This particular company is not very profitable. Another firm may 
generate just $100 million in profits but only need $500 million to do so, boasting a 20% return on capital. This 
company is highly profitable. A return on capital of 20% means that for every $1.00 that investors put into the company, 
the company earns $0.20 per year.

　　公司需要资金来运作和发展他们的业务，以便为他们的投资者带来回报。投资者把资金(称为资本)投资到一家公司，然后公司有责任为投资者创造额外的利润，
即所谓的利润。利润与资本的比率称为资本回报。重要的是要记住，以美元计算的利润的绝对水平，并不比利润占资本投资的百分比重要。


　　举例来说，一家公司在某一年的利润可能达到10亿美元，但它可能已经花费了200亿美元的资本来实现这一目标，因此资本回报率仅为5%。这家公司
利润不大。另一家公司可能只获得1亿美元的利润，但只需要5亿美元就可以实现，资本回报率为20%。这家公司利润很高。20%的资本回报率意味着投资者
投入公司的每1美元，公司每年的收益为0.20美元。
##两种类型的资本
Before discussing return on capital further, it is important to distinguish between the two types of capital. As we 
mentioned above, two types of investors invest capital into companies: creditors ("loaners") and shareholders ("owners"). 
Creditors provide a company with debt capital, and shareholders provide a company with equity capital. 

Creditors are typically banks, bondholders, and suppliers. They lend money to companies in exchange for a fixed return 
on their debt capital, usually in the form of interest payments. Companies also agree to pay back the principal on their loans.

The interest rate will be higher than the interest rate of government bonds, because companies generally have a higher 
risk of defaulting on their interest payments and principal. Lenders generally require a return on their loans that is 
commensurate with the risks associated with the individual company. Therefore, a steady company will borrow money 
cheaply (lower interest payments), but a risky business will have to pay more (higher interest payments).

Shareholders that supply companies with equity capital are typically banks, mutual or hedge funds, and private investors. 
They give money to a company in exchange for an ownership interest in that business. Unlike creditors, shareholders do not get a fixed return on their investment because they are part owners of the company. When a company sells shares to the public (in other words, "goes public" to be "publicly traded"), it is actually selling an ownership stake in itself and not a promise to pay a fixed amount each year.

Shareholders are entitled to the profits, if any, generated by the company after everyone else--employees, vendors, 
lenders--gets paid. The more shares you own, the greater your claim on these profits and potential dividends. Owners 
have potentially unlimited upside profits, but they could also lose their entire investment if the company fails. 

It is also important to keep in mind a company's total number of shares outstanding at any given time. Shareholders 
can benefit more from owning one share of a billion-dollar company that has only 100 shares (a 1% ownership interest) 
than by owning 100 shares of a billion-dollar company that has a million shares outstanding (a 0.01% ownership interest). 

　　在进一步讨论资本回报率之前，区分这两种类型的资本是很重要的。正如我们上面提到的，两种类型的投资者将资金投入公司:债权人(“债权人”)和
股东(“所有者”)。债权人为公司提供债务资本，股东为公司提供股权资本。

　　债权人通常是银行、债券持有人和供应商。他们借钱给公司以换取固定的债务资本回报，通常是以利息支付的形式。公司还同意偿还贷款本金。

　　利率将高于政府债券的利率，因为公司通常会有较高的违约风险。贷方通常要求其贷款的回报与个人公司相关的风险相称。因此，一个稳定的公司会以较低的
利率借入资金(较低的利息支付)，但高风险的企业将不得不支付更高的利息(更高的利息)。

　　为公司提供股本的股东通常是银行、共同基金或对冲基金，以及私人投资者。他们把钱给一家公司，以换取对该业务的所有权利益。与债权人不同，股东没有
固定的投资回报，因为他们是公司的股东。当一家公司向公众出售股份时(换句话说，“上市”是“公开交易”)，它实际上是在出售自己的股权，而不是承诺
每年支付一定数量的股份。

　　股东有权获得公司的利润(如果有的话)，在其他人——员工、供应商、贷款机构——获得报酬之后，公司就会产生利润。你持有的股票越多，你对这些利润和
潜在股息的要求就越高。所有者拥有潜在的无限利润，但如果公司倒闭，他们也可能失去全部投资。

　　同样重要的是，要记住一个公司在任何特定时间内的股票总数。股东们可以从拥有价值10亿美元的公司中获得更多的利益，而不是拥有100个拥有100万股份
的公司的100个股份(所有者权益为0.01%)。

##Once a Profit Is Created...
Companies usually pay out their profits in the form of dividends, or they reinvest the money back into the business. 
Dividends provide shareholders with a cash payment, and reinvested earnings offer shareholders the chance to receive 
more profits from the underlying business in the future. Many companies, especially young ones, pay no dividends. 
Any profits they make are plowed back into their businesses.

One of the most important jobs of any company's management is to decide whether to pay out profits as dividends or to 
reinvest the money back into the business. Companies that care about shareholders will reinvest the money only if they 
have promising opportunities to invest in--opportunities that should earn a higher return than shareholders could get 
on their own.
##Different Capital, Different Risk, Different Return

Debt and equity capital each have different risk profiles. Therefore, as we showed in Lesson 103, each type of capital 
offers investors different return opportunities. Creditors shoulder less risk than shareholders because they are accepting 
a lower rate of return on the debt capital they supply to a company. When a company pays out the profits generated each 
year, creditors are paid before anyone else. Creditors can break up a company if it does not have sufficient money to 
cover its interest payments, and they wield a big stick. 

Consequently, companies understand that there is a big difference between borrowing money from creditors and raising 
money from shareholders. If a firm is unable to pay the interest on a corporate bond or the principal when it comes due, 
the company is bankrupt. The creditors can then come in and divvy up the firm's assets in order to recover whatever they 
can from their investments. Any assets left over after the creditors are done belong to shareholders, but often such 
leftovers do not amount to much, if anything at all.

Shareholders take on more risk than creditors because they only get the profits left over after everyone else gets paid. 
If nothing is left over, they receive nothing in return. They are the "residual" claimants to a company's profits. 
However, there is an important trade-off. If a company generates lots of profits, shareholders enjoy the highest returns. 
The sky is the limit for owners and their profits. Meanwhile, loaners keep receiving the same interest payment year 
in and year out, regardless of how high the company's profits may reach. By contrast, owners keep whatever profits are 
left over. And the more that is left over, the higher their return on capital.
##Return on Capital and Return on Stock
The market often takes a long time to reward shareholders with a return on stock that corresponds to a company's return 
on capital. To better understand this statement, it is crucial to separate return on capital from return on stock. 
Return on capital is a measure of a company's profitability, but return on stock represents a combination of dividends 
and increases in the stock price (better known as capital gains). The two simple formulas below outline the return 
calculations in more detail:

Return on Capital: Profit / (Invested Capital)

Return on Stock: Shareholder Total Return = Capital Gains + Dividends

The market frequently forgets the important relationship between return on capital and return on stock. A company can 
earn a high return on capital but shareholders could still suffer if the market price of the stock decreases over the 
same period. Similarly, a terrible company with a low return on capital may see its stock price increase if the firm 
performed less terribly than the market had expected. Or maybe the company is currently losing lots of money, but 
investors have bid up its stock in anticipation of future profits.

In other words, in the short term, there can be a disconnect between how a company performs and how its stock performs. 
This is because a stock's market price is a function of the market's perception of the value of the future profits a 
company can create. Sometimes this perception is spot on; sometimes it is way off the mark. But over a longer period 
of time, the market tends to get it right, and the performance of a company's stock will mirror the performance of the 
underlying business.
##The Voting and Weighing Machines
The father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, explained this concept by saying that in the short run, the market is 
like a voting machine--tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is like a 
weighing machine--assessing the substance of a company. The message is clear: What matters in the long run is a company's 
actual underlying business performance and not the investing public's fickle opinion about its prospects in the short run.

Over the long term, when companies perform well, their shares will do so, too. And when a company's business suffers, 
the stock will also suffer. For example, Starbucks (SBUX) has had phenomenal success at turning coffee--a simple product 
that used to be practically given away--into a premium product that people are willing to pay up for. Over time, Starbucks 
has enjoyed handsome growth in number of stores, profits, and share price. Starbucks also has a respectable return on 
invested capital of over 20%.

Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) has languished. It has had a difficult time competing with discount stores and strip malls, 
and it has not enjoyed any meaningful profit growth in years. Plus, its return on invested capital rarely tops 10%. 
As a result, its stock has bounced around without really going anywhere in decades.
##The Bottom Line
In the end, stocks are ownership interests in companies. We can't emphasize this fact enough. Being a stockholder is 
being a partial owner of a company.
Over the long term, a company's business performance and its stock price will converge. The market rewards companies 
that earn high returns on capital over a long period. Companies that earn low returns may get an occasional bounce in 
the short term, but their long-term performance will be just as miserable as their returns on capital. The wealth a 
company creates--as measured by returns on capital--will find its way to shareholders over the long term in the form 
of dividends or stock appreciation.

#206: 更多的竞争定位
##简介

　　在上一课中，我们回顾了不同类型的防御(经济护城河)，并提供了宽护城河公司的例子。理解护城河，决定一个公司是否有护城河是一个棘手的过程。在这节课中，我们将检验护城河模型是如何起作用的，并探索宽护城河、窄护城河和深护城河的一些细微差别。

##波特五力模型

　　迈克尔·e·波特(Michael E. Porter)的《竞争战略》(Competitive Strategy)最初发表于1980年，是一部关于行业竞争的权威著作。在这本书中，这位哈佛大学的教授为理解竞争对手的行为和公司在其产业中的战略定位提供了一个框架。我们应该属性这个模型的大部分, 因为这个模型巩固了我们对经济护城河的思考。

　　从本质上讲，波特提供了一个五力模型，可以用来理解一个行业的结构。由于公司都在争取竞争优势，前四种力量有助于评估第五种力量，即行业的竞争水平:

    * **进入壁垒**。新公司开始在市场上竞争有多容易?壁垒越高越好。   
    * **买方(客户)的权力**。与转换成本类似，如果价格上涨，是什么让客户留下来，还是让他们购买其他竞争对手的产品?权利越低越好。
    * **供应商的权利**。一个公司如何控制其商品和服务的成本?权利越低越好。
    * **替代品的威胁**。一家公司可能是最好的小部件制造商，但如果小部件很快就会过时呢?还有，有没有更便宜或更好的选择?
    * **竞争的程度**。包括以上四个因素，一个公司的产业竞争力如何?各公司在每一美元上都在打一场血战吗?多少次护城河试图被破坏，利润被偷走?
    
　　综合考虑波特五力模型可以帮助你确定一个公司是否有经济护城河。这个模型对于研究一个公司的外部竞争环境特别有用。毕竟，如果一家公司的竞争对手实力较弱，可能不需要多少护城河就能将他们挡在门外。同样，如果一家公司处于竞争激烈的行业，它可能需要更多的护城河来捍卫自己的利润。

##五力模型的例子: 消费品

　　五力模型最好通过例子来解释。(波特的作品简直棒极了，但读起来却很沉重。)让我们简单地考察一下家用消费品行业，看看竞争对手高乐士(Clorox CLX)、金佰利(Kimberly-Clark KMB)、高露洁-棕榄(Colgate-Palmolive  CL)和宝洁公司(Procter & Gamble PG)在波特五力方面的表现:

　　**买方权利**。消费品公司面临的买家权利薄弱，因为客户分散，对价格或产品几乎没有影响。但是，如果我们把消费产品的购买者看作是零售商而不是个人，那么这些公司就会面临非常强大的购买力。沃尔玛(Wal-Mart)和塔吉特(Target TGT)等零售商可以与像高乐士(Clorox)这样的公司进行价格谈判，因为他们购买和销售了很多高乐士(Clorox)的产品。结论:来自零售商的强大买方权利。
    Supplier Power. More than likely, consumer-products companies face some amount of supplier power simply because of the costs they incur when switching suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers that do a large amount of business with these companies--supplying Kimberly-Clark with raw materials for its diapers, for instance--also are somewhat beholden to their customers, like Kimberly-Clark. Nevertheless, bargaining power for both the firms and their suppliers is probably limited. Verdict: Limited supplier power.

    Threat of New Entrants. Given the amount of capital investment needed to enter certain segments in household consumer products, such as manufacturing deodorants, we suspect the threat of new entrants is fairly low in the industry. In some segments within the household consumer-products industry, this may not be the case since a small manufacturer could develop a superior product, such as a detergent, and compete with Procter & Gamble. The test is whether the small manufacturer can get its products on the shelves of the same retailers as its much larger rivals. Verdict: Low threat of new entrants.
    Threat of Substitutes. Within the consumer-products industry, brands succeed in helping to build a competitive advantage, but even the pricing power of brands can be eroded with substitutes such as store-branded private-label offerings. In fact, some of these same store-brand private-label products are manufactured by the large consumer-products firms. The firms believe that if they can manufacture and package a lower-price alternative themselves, they would rather accept the marginal revenue from their lower-priced items than risk completely losing the sale to a private-label competitor. Verdict: High threat of substitutes.
    Degree of Rivalry. Consumers in this category enjoy a multitude of choices for everything from cleaning products to bath washes. While many consumers prefer certain brands, switching costs in this industry are quite low. It does not cost anything for a consumer to buy one brand of shampoo instead of another. This, along with a variety of other factors, including the forces we've already examined, makes the industry quite competitive. Verdict: High degree of rivalry.
    Examining an industry through the framework of Porter's five forces helps illustrate the different dynamics at work. It's not always clear-cut, either, so one wouldn't expect all of the firms in this industry to fall into one big bucket labeled wide moat or narrow moat. Instead, there are firms with distinct, long-term advantages and wide moats, like Procter & Gamble and Colgate, while others have advantages that we think may be less sustainable, such as Clorox and Kimberly-Clark.

    Getting Back to Moats

    Porter's framework makes scouring an industry for great investment ideas much easier. Understanding an industry helps us find the great businesses with economic moats that will withstand the inevitable economic, competitive, and random other challenges that often cripple weaker businesses.
    Once we have a collection of great businesses from which to choose, finding those that meet our criteria and deliver above-average returns on invested capital over the long term becomes even easier. (We will discuss returns on invested capital more in Lesson 305.)
    Generally speaking, we believe investors should steer clear of companies that have no moat (those with a Morningstar moat rating of "none") because they have very few, if any, competitive advantages and can't keep rivals from eating away at their profits. (Lots of these companies don't even have any profits.) For example, we don't think Delta Air Lines DAL, SUPERVALU SVU, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber GT have moats around their respective businesses. More than likely, we wouldn't want to hold a no-moat company for the long haul, so we probably wouldn't buy stock in one of these firms to begin with.
    Some people are shrewd enough to buy no-moat stocks on a dip, hold them for a short term, and make a profit. As long-term investors this isn't a game we like to play. We think the rewards are far better, and the risks much lower, for those who spend a little effort to find strong companies to hold for a long time.
    Types of Narrow Moats

    There are certainly gradations of moat width, and we here at Morningstar describe companies with milder competitive advantages as having "narrow" moats. From our point of view, far more companies have narrow moats than wide ones. Narrow-moat firms are, on average, of a much higher quality than no-moat companies. Generally, narrow-moat companies generate lower returns on invested capital than wide-moat companies but still have returns slightly above their cost of capital. (We will talk about return on invested capital and cost of capital extensively in coming lessons.) Narrow-moat companies typically come in two varieties:
    Firms with Eroding Moats. These companies have competitive advantages, but they are eroding due to a shifting industry landscape. This scenario is faced by some of the consumer-products companies, like those we just examined. For example, we consider both General Mills GIS and Kellogg K to be narrow-moat firms. The pricing power they once enjoyed is eroding as a result of increased competition and an ever-consolidating retail landscape that is increasing buyer power. The Baby Bells, such as AT&T  T and Verizon VZ, are another example; their economic moats are also slowly eroding. In future years, they won't enjoy the monopoly pricing power they once did because of the increased use of wireless phones and, of course, the Internet.
    Firms with Structural Industry Challenges. A company in this category dominates its peers, but resides in an industry where wide moats are nearly impossible to create. For example, Waste Management  WMI has a solid position in the waste services industry. The trash taker is the largest operator of landfills in the country, a position that is nearly impossible to replicate due to political and citizens' group opposition. Such barriers to entry in waste disposal are augmented by regional scale and route density on the collection side of its business, which makes life difficult for local independent haulers. This competitive position allows it to garner real pricing increases, which help to mitigate rising diesel fuel prices and cyclical declines in waste volume. 
    Wide Moats

    All things equal, we'd choose a wide-moat company over one with a narrow-moat rating for the significant competitive advantages that should enable the wide-moat firm to earn more than its cost of capital for many years to come.
    Most wide-moat companies have some sort of structural advantage versus competitors. By "structural," we mean a fundamental advantage in the company's business model that wouldn't go away even if the current management team did. With a structural advantage, a company isn't dependent on having a great management team to remain profitable. To paraphrase Peter Lynch, these are companies that could turn a profit even with a monkey running them, and it's a good thing, because at some point that may happen.
    We hate to sound like a broken record here, but the four types of moats that we identified in the previous lesson are incredibly useful when thinking about structural advantages a company may or may not possess. Keep the four types of moats in mind:
    •  Low-Cost Producer or Economies of Scale
    •  High Switching Costs
    •  Network Effect
    •  Intangible Assets

    Wide Moats Versus Deep Moats
    With the concept of a wide moat firmly in place, it's also important to realize that the width of a firm's moat, or how broad and numerous its competitive advantages are, matters more than the moat's depth, or how impressive any individual advantage is. Discerning between width and depth can be difficult, however.
    First, it's absolutely critical to understand not only what an economic moat is, but also how it translates to above-average returns on capital. Many investors easily surmise the first point about moats--that a competitive advantage is required--but they miss the importance of the second point, above-average returns. If the business doesn't throw off attractive returns, then who cares if it has a competitive advantage? Autos and airlines are two businesses with some barriers to entry, but few new competitors are trying to crash the party in a race for single-digit ROEs or bankruptcy.
    Over the years, Warren Buffett has frequently referred to his desire to widen the moats of his companies, but it's rare to see him refer to a moat's depth. Buffett's frequent talk of moat width--and silence on moat depth--speaks volumes. Michael E. Porter has said, "Positions built on systems of activities are far more sustainable than those built on individual activities."
    Unfortunately, no company is going to tell you if it has a moat, much less whether that moat is of the wide or deep variety. If a firm has a competitive advantage, it behooves it to not tell you how its moat has been built. After all, you just might emulate it.
    Still, it can be worth investors' time to ponder whether the stocks they're invested in have one really fantastic competitive advantage that, while deep, may lack width, or if they're invested in firms with a series of advantages that can sustain above-average returns on capital over the long haul.
    Consider well-run giant conglomerates like General Electric GE or Citigroup C. Finance theory tells us that these decades-old firms should have seen their returns on capital dribble down to their cost of capital ages ago due to rivals competing away the excess returns. (We'll talk much more about returns on capital and cost of capital in coming lessons.) Yet, Citigroup's ROEs are still in the upper teens even in a bad year.
    Why haven't competitors captured these profits? Quite simply, these firms are pretty good at an awful lot of things. If Citigroup is hobbled by problems in its private banking unit or regulatory scandals on its trading desks, it can rely on its impressive credit card operations and retail banking business to carry the day. At GE, if new competition from cable hurts the NBC network or its insurance division posts lackluster returns, it can rely on a cadre of numerous other good businesses to pick up the slack. Like stacked plywood, each of these businesses is strong in its own right, but virtually indestructible together.

    The Bottom Line
    This and the preceding lesson have covered a lot of material about moats and the qualitative aspects of a company's positioning. Though this step in identifying attractive companies for investment is an important one, it is only the first step. In coming lessons in this book, we will show you how to quantitatively confirm that a company has a moat, as well as show you how to value stocks so that you don't blindly pay too much for a quality company.
